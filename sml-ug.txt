<<<KEYPOINTS

This user guide describes how to construct documents using
[a:SML]. ~~This~~ document was written in [a:SML].  [a:SML] is a
minimalistic plain text [g:SML:descriptive markup] language designed
to:

- be human readable

- enable [g:SML:continuous integration] of documentation

- express and validate [g:SML:semantic] relationships

- be easy to edit

- be easy to generate automatically

- publish complex documents

- publish libraries of related documents

Why call it ``[acl:SML]''?

index:: Semantic Manuscript Language; SML

SML enables you to express the [g:SML:semantics] (~~meaning~~) of the
text so that applications can automatically ~~reason~~ about document
content.

A [g:SML:manuscript] is the ~~original~~ form for a published
document. Authors use SML to capture ideas in an ~~original~~ form
that can be processed and published into multiple renditions.

The concept of a ``semantic manuscript'' aligns well with my purpose
to enable authors to create readable, modular, documents and re-usable
document fragments which can be automatically published to multiple
renditions and processed by applications that can reason about their
meaning.

[a:SML] enables you to represent full-length, full-featured, high-quality
books, reports, and articles in minimally formatted text files.  Its
simple mark-up rules ensure the plain text manuscript is easy to read,
but still contains everything necessary to turn the text into a
professionally typeset hardcopy or web content.

[a:SML] documents can be rendered to:

- [a:PDF]

- [a:HTML]

- [a:XML]

- [a:CSV][f:getting-started:1]

index:: published rendition!PDF; published rendition!HTML; published
rendition!XML; published rendition!RTF; published rendition!CSV

[a:SML] is free (licensed under the [a:GPL]). I've implemented a free
codebase in Perl 5 that includes a parser and publisher.

index:: LaTeX; PDFLaTeX

#------------------------------
# footnotes

footnote::1: The CSV rendition only captures the structured data
portions of the document such as requirements, configuration_items,
tests, and tasks.  It is useful for exporting these structured
elements of the document to a spreadsheet or database.

** Documentation Is Like Software

The purpose of this section is to convince you it's better to write
documentation using [a:SML] than a word processor.

Why don't we write ~~software~~ the way we write ~~documentation~~?
Because it would be ~~terribly~~ inefficient and result in
unmaintainable software.

>>>COMMENT

When people first began writing computer programs, they wrote the
exact steps they wanted the computer to perform.  This was tedious.

<<<COMMENT

Most people write documentation using a word processor like Microsoft
Word^^[rtm]^^. Word processors have you construct the content,
structure, and format of a document simultaneously all in a single
file.  What you see is what you get.  It's simple.

Word processors force us into practices long ago discarded as
[g:SML:anti-pattern]s by programmers. Ask yourself if ~~you~~ use any
of these common ``documentation anti-patterns'' when ~~you~~ write
documents.

- ~~Copy and paste documentation~~ -- Do you ever find yourself
copying from one document and pasting into another?  Of course you do.
Multiple documents often need to contain the same text.  Rather than
writing the information each time from scratch, you copy from one
document into the others. I do this all the time with documents.  I
used to do this with code until I found myself updating the same code
in six places.  I decided to modularize my code into libraries and now
I can use the same code in many places but maintainin it in only one.
The same is true of documentation.  When I want the same text in
multiple documents I just save it as an SML [g:SML:FRAGMENT] and
maintain it in one place.

- ~~Write Once and Done~~ -- Similar to the [g:IEEE:waterfall model]
of software development, the write-once-and-done method of document
development incorrectly assumes documentation can be manufactured like
physical products through a series of sequential steps: draft, review,
edit, finalize. It under-emphasizes the need to continuously update
documentation to capture changing information. This method often
accompanies a simple compliance mindset of `churning out' required
documentation.  Such `one-time' documentation rarely serves its
intended purpose.  If you have old documentation that no longer serves
its intended purpose, you've fallen into this trap.

Advantages of ``compiling'' documentation:

- modularization

- validation

- multiple output formats

- consistent formatting

######################################################################

**.why-use-sml Why Use SML?

Why Use [a:SML]? Productivity.  Most people use a `modern' word
processor, like Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org Writer, to write
documents. An unfortunate side effect of `modern' word processors is
that authors spend time fiddling with styles and alternative
presentations when they should be writing.[f:why-use-sml:1] I wish I
could calculate the lost productivity due to easily distracted authors
who waste their time playing with formatting options rather than doing
the hard work of producing quality content.

Here is a short list of reasons you might consider using [a:SML]
rather than a traditional word processor:

- !!Productivity.!!  [a:SML] eliminates most presentation options,
  forcing authors to focus on structure and content, making them more
  productive. The absence of presentation information also enables you
  to more easily re-use the content.

- !!Re-usability.!!  Word processors do not provide an easy way to
  re-use document content.  If you want to use the same content in
  multiple documents, you cut-and-paste from one document to the
  other. Now you must maintain the content in two places.  [a:SML]
  enables you to modularize your content to re-use chunks wherever you
  would like.

- !!Modularity.!! You should modularize the content of most major
  works (books, reference documents, requirements documents) to enable
  many people to work on different parts of the document at the same
  time.  If you store your 600+ page reference document in Microsoft
  Word, only one person at a time can make changes.  With the help of
  CVS[f:why-use-sml:2] or Subversion[f:why-use-sml:3], [a:SML] enables
  multiple people to work on the ~~same~~ part of the document at the
  ~~same~~ time and automatically merge the changes.

- !!Revision Control.!! You can benefit from a disciplined approach to
  document creation and management by keeping your [a:SML] files under
  revision control.  You'll gain these benefits:

  - Know who made each change, when and why.

  - If necessary, revert documents back to a previous revision.

  - Retrieve a previous revision.

  - Gain insight into work performed on a project by reviewing the
    change log.

  - Keep automatic backups.

- !!Plain Text.!! The content of an [a:SML] document is plain text rather
  than a proprietary format like Microsoft Word.

  - Plain text is easier to manipulate using simple programs and
    scripts.

  - Plain text is easier to re-use in other applications like
    spreadsheets and databases.

  - Nothing is hidden.  Unlike binary file formats, nothing is hidden
    in a plain text document.

- !!Automation.!! Since [a:SML] is plain text, it is easy to automate the
  construction and publication of documents.  This is the key to
  quickly producing high-quality documents with few people.

- !!High Quality Hardcopy.!!  [a:SML] uses the [cmd:pdflatex] program,
  part of the TeX/LaTeX family of typesetting applications to create
  high-quality hardcopy (via PDF).  This is the same software used to
  typeset many text books.  It produces higher quality typeset
  documentation than a word-processing program like Microsoft Word.

- !!Traceability.!! [a:SML] features rich traceability features for
  systems engineering documentation.

When you pick up a good looking document, you know something is
different.  But, what makes it ``professional looking?''  You know
that your college textbooks look better than your word-processed term
papers, but can you enumerate the design decisions that made the
textbook look ``professional?''

You need a surprising amount of expertise to produce professional
looking typeset (or online) documents. Few people are experts in
~~both~~ the subject of their writing ~~and~~ the art of typographic
design or online presentation.  Good content gets presented badly; and
authors, who should be writing, waste their time with styles and
presentation options trying to make their documents look ``good.''

[a:SML] eliminates most presentation options.  This forces you to
concentrate on the structure and content rather than the
presentation. Sorry, it's for your own good :-).  Within the
||publish|| program, I've codified rules for typesetting easy-to-read,
professional looking documents.  You'll be surprised and pleased at
the quality of documents you can produce.

The ||publish|| program can create five different renditions: PDF,
HTML, RTF, XML and CSV.[f:why-use-sml:4] The PDF rendition is created
using LaTeX (actually [g:PDFLaTeX]) to produce very high quality
typeset output.

You can use this system to publish any document, but it was
specifically designed to publish ~~training material~~, ~~requirements
documents~~, ~~project documentation~~, ~~test results~~, and
~~automatically generated documentation~~.

- For ~~training material~~, it provides special structures for
  exercises, demonstrations, and presentation slides.

- For ~~requirements documents~~, it provides a way to establish
  formal traceability between ~~problems~~ (i.e. requirements),
  ~~solutions~~ (i.e. system components), and ~~tests~~.  It also has
  a mechanism for prioritizing requirements based on priority and
  status.

- For ~~project documentation~~, it provides a way to track tasks.

- For ~~test results~~, it provides a way to automatically generate
  test result documentation by merging tests and result summaries.

- The ``||script::||'' and ``||generate::||'' [g:SML:element]s provide
  powerful ways to ~~automatically generate~~ high-quality
  documentation.

index:: presentation; structure; content

[a:SML] is a ~~structured text~~ language designed to describe document
content and structure ~~but not the presentation~~. With the exception
of the limited presentation features listed in
[ref:tab-presentation-syntax], it intentionally takes away the
ability to specify document presentation.

[a:SML] is a carefully designed, extremely minimal, descriptive markup
language.  It was designed for simplicity of editing with a plain text
editor.  [a:SML] text files are like the source code for documents
(i.e. the ``manuscript''), and the ||publish|| program is like a
compiler that `builds' (renders) the documents in a variety of
renditions.

Although [a:SML] is a markup language (like SGML, XML, or HTML), the
actual markup has been reduced to a bare minimum to improve the
readability of the text and simplicity of editing.  For this reason,
the language is not as flexible as XML.  In return for this loss of
flexibility, however, you gain ease of use.  Normal people don't like
to edit raw XML in a text editor because it's too complicated, and
it's too easy to introduce errors.[f:why-use-sml:5] My hope is that
``normal'' people (well, programmers anyway) are willing to edit [a:SML]
documents using a simple text editor.

One benefit is reuseability.  Not only can you publish [a:SML] documents
in a variety of forms, but you can also modularize the content and
reuse bits and pieces in different documents.  Using the
``||include::||'' [g:SML:element], the actual text can be stored in
one file and reused in many others.

Descriptive markup can be used to describe format, structure, and
content:

- Elements of ~~structure~~ are the building blocks of a document
  like titles, paragraphs, sections, lists, list items, tables, and
  figures.

- Elements of ~~content~~ describe the meaning of the text like
  exercises, demonstrations, problems, and solutions.

- Elements of ~~presentation~~ (or style) describe how text is to be
  presented like bold, italics, font-family, and font-size.

Beginning in [ref:structure-syntax-summary] I'll enumerate the
features of [a:SML] in terms of format, structure, and content.  But
before we get into lists of these features, let's take a look at a
simple example.

footnote::4: Some of these formats are more mature than others.  PDF,
HTML, and CSV rendering are quite good.  XML rendering is pretty good,
while RTF rendering is only in the early stages of development.

footnote::5: Actually, I've discovered ``normal'' people don't like to
edit text in a text editor either, but that opens up a whole other set

**.example A Step-By-Step Example

index::begin: sample document

:yellow: NOTE: This step-by-step example is out of date. If you try to
follow it you'll be disappointed :-(. I plan to update it in an
upcoming release.  -- Don Johnson, 2016-01-02

---

Here is a step-by-step example of creating and publishing an [a:SML]
document using the ||publish|| program.

index:: example; Emacs; text editor

step:: ~~Start Your Favorite Text Editor.~~ You can use notepad or
wordpad on Windows, or any of the gazillion text editors that come
with most Linux distributions.  My favorite text editor is Emacs.
You'll discover there are some built-in advantages to using Emacs to
edit [a:SML] documents.

step:: ~~Type The Following.~~ [ref:lis-sample-document] shows a simple
document with a title, author, a handful of paragraphs and a list.
Type this (or cut and paste it) into the text editor.

>>>LISTING.lis-sample-document

title:: A Sample Document

file:: files/sample-document.txt

<<<LISTING

step:: ~~Save.~~ Save the text in a file named ||sample-document.txt||.

index:: GUI

step:: ~~Start Publish.~~ Start the ||publish|| program.  If you've
got the Windows executable version simply double-click on the
||publish.exe|| file.  If you've got the Perl script version, run
`||perl publish.pl|| [[Enter]]'.  You'll see the graphical user
interface appear ([ref:fig-publish-window]).[f:example:1]

step:: ~~Select File to Publish.~~ Click ~~browse...~~ and use the
file chooser to select the ||sample-document.txt|| file you just
created.

step:: ~~Select PDF.~~ Check the ~~PDF~~ box to publish a PDF
rendition of the document (it's checked by default).

step:: ~~Publish.~~ Press the green ~~Publish Document~~ button.  The
button will turn red and say `Publishing...'  while the program is
publishing the document.  If everything is set up correctly, after a
little while you'll be presented with a PDF rendition of the sample
document ([ref:fig-sample-document-pdf]).

>>>FIGURE.fig-sample-document-pdf

title:: PDF Rendition Of The Sample Document

image:: files/images/sample-document-pdf.png

width:: 6in

description:: [a:SML] uses LaTeX to perform high quality typesetting of
the PDF rendition.

<<<FIGURE

You can also publish an HTML rendition.

step:: ~~Choose HTML.~~ Un-check the ~~PDF~~ box and check the ~~HTML~~
one.

step:: ~~Publish.~~ Press the green ~~Publish Document~~ button.
Again, if everything is set up right, after a little while you'll be
presented with an HTML rendition of the sample document
([ref:fig-sample-document-html]).

Now you know the mechanics of how to publish an [a:SML] document.  All
that's left is to learn the rules of [a:SML], which are really not very
complicated.

The following sections summarize the features supported by [a:SML],
divided into format, structure, content, and special feature
categories.  For the gory details see [title:sml-language].

#------------------------------
# footnotes

footnote::1: If you're one of those crazy computer types who knows how
to run programs from the mythical `command line,' you can publish the
document with the command `||publish -r pdf sample-document.txt||
[[Enter]]'

######################################################################

**.structure-syntax-summary Summary of Structure Syntax

index::begin: structure syntax

Elements of ~~structure~~ are the building blocks of a document like:
titles, paragraphs, sections, lists, list items, tables, and
figures. The elements of structure supported by [a:SML] are summarized in
[ref:tab-structure-syntax].

Footnote markers can go inside tables but footnote text should come
after the table; likewise, footnote markers can go in list items, but
the footnote text should be placed after the end of the list.

As a matter of style, I've gotten into the habit of prefixing all
labels with three letters to indicate the type of document component
being labeled: ||tab-|| for table labels, ||fig-|| for figure labels,
||lis-|| for listing labels, ||sec-|| for section labels, etc.

Elements of ~~presentation~~ (or style) describe how text is to be
presented.  These include features like: bold, italics, font-family,
and font-size.  [ref:tab-presentation-syntax] lists supported
presentation syntax.

######################################################################

** Summary of Special Features

index::begin: special features

[a:SML] has special features designed to support tasks like: development
of instructor notes for training courses, system requirements and
design documentation, and publishing of full length books.
[ref:tab-special-features] summarizes these special features.

>>>TABLE.tab-special-features

title:: Summary of Special Features

column::1:width: 50
column::2:width: 50

column::1:head: Feature
column::2:head: Example

include:: sml-special-summary

<<<TABLE

You'll see features in [a:SML] specifically designed to help you produce
course materials such as presentation slides, demonstrations, and
exercises.  I've found the ||publish|| program useful for a lot of
other jobs as well, and so I've added more and more features over
time.  My goal is to keep [a:SML] very simple while providing a rich set
of features useful to people creating formal documentation of all
kinds.

To avoid infinite loops caused by scripts calling other scripts, there
is a ||$MAX_PASS_TWO_ITERATIONS|| variable which defaults to 10 to
limit the number of recursions.

index::end: special features

######################################################################

** Alternatives

There are alternative programs with features similar to using [a:SML]:

- Markdown ([url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown])

- CommonMark ([url:http://commonmark.org/])

- reStructuredText  ([url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText])

- Plain Old Documentation ([url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Documentation])

- Emacs Muse ([url:http://www.mwolson.org/projects/MuseMode.html])

**.pros-and-cons Pros and Cons

index::begin: pros and cons

Why use [a:SML] to publish your documentation instead of a word
processor like MSWord or OpenOffice.org?  Here are some pros and cons
of using [a:SML] instead of a word processor to produce documents.

: !!PROS!!

- ~~Concentrate on writing content.~~ - [a:SML] removes the
distractions and time-consuming struggles of choosing the appearance
of your content.

- ~~No Presentation Inconsistencies.~~ - Inconsistencies in the
appearance of your documents are eliminated since the ||publish||
program renders the presentation of the document for you.

- ~~Easier to Learn Than LaTeX.~~ - If you want to get started
producing beautiful documents with LaTeX, using the ||publish||
program is a great way to start.  Learning the [a:SML] rules is easier
than learning LaTeX.

- ~~Your content is future proof.~~ - Plain text is going to be around
for a long long time.

- ~~Modularize your content.~~ - The `include' feature enables you to
modularize your content and make components reusable.

- ~~Nothing is hidden.~~ - Since all the content is plain text,
nothing is hidden.  There are no mysterious problems due to the
tangled mess you get with some word processor formats.

- ~~Publish to many renditions.~~ - Use the same source document to
produce HTML, PDF, CSV, RTF, XML, and even publish the structured data
to CSV.[f:pros-and-cons:1]

- ~~Separate style from content.~~ - Want to change the style across
the board?  Change the style sheet without touching the
content.[f:pros-and-cons:2]

- ~~Automatically produce documents.~~ - It's easy to write programs
that output data in [a:SML].  Furthermore, you can run the ||publish||
program from the command line or call it from other programs.

- ~~Documents that write themselves!~~ - Using the `script' feature,
you can produce documents that write themselves (even recursively).
Imagine writing a computer security vulnerability assessment report
that automatically performs the vulnerability assessment while
publishing the report!

- ~~High Quality Typeset Output~~ - The program uses LaTeX to produce
extremely high quality typeset output.  This level of typesetting
quality is hard to achieve even with the best word processors.

: !!CONS!!

- ~~Using a Text Editor.~~ - You must edit plain text rather than
using a WYSIWYG word processor.  Few individuals apart from
programmers are comfortable using a plain text editor.

- ~~Learning the Semantic Manuscript Language~~ - You must learn the
Semantic Manuscript Language.  Even though it is designed to be as
simple as possible, you still have to learn the [a:SML] rules.

- ~~Poor for layout intensive work.~~ - The ||publish|| program is not
good for layout intensive documents like pamphlets or newsletters.

- ~~Limitations of SML~~ - You may need some feature not supported by
[a:SML].  If you find this to be the case, let me know (drj826@acm.org)
and I might implement that feature.

---

index::end: pros and cons

#------------------------------
# footnotes

footnote::1: HTML and PDF renditions are mature, as of this writing
output to RTF was still in the initial phases of development, CSV
output is for structured data, and XML output is to a very simple XML
DTD (DOCBOOK support is envisioned in the future).

footnote::2: As of this writing, stylesheet support had not been
implemented but is planned for the future.

######################################################################

** What Makes A Document Easy To Read?

Despite my best efforts to make the ||publish|| program a tool that
produces professional looking, easy-to-read documents, it still gives
you the flexibility to produce hard-to-read documents.  What makes a
document easy to read?  Here are some rules of thumb for creating
professional looking, readable documents:

- ~~Line Length.~~ Use lines that contain no more than 75 characters,
  including punctuation and spaces.

- ~~Vertical Whitespace.~~

- ~~Visual Structure Reflects Logical Structure.~~

######################################################################

** Characteristics of Poor Technical Documentation

Technical documentation is any documentation in which the meaning of
terms must be used with precision.  Characteristics of poor technical
documentation include:

+ No glossary.

+ No index.

+ No front-matter (table of contents, list of tables, etc.)

+ Inconsistent use of styles.

** Output Goes To The Output Directory

The ||publish|| program creates a directory containing all of its
output.  For example, if you publish an [a:SML] file called
``my-notes.txt'' it will create the directory structure shown in
[ref:fig-dir-output] as output.

>>>FIGURE.fig-dir-output

**.how-it-works How It Works

We kind of jumped right into how to run the program and publish a
document.  Let's take a moment to step back and look at the big
picture of what's going on.  [ref:fig-publishing-flowchart] shows a
flowchart of the steps in creating and publishing both HTML and LaTeX
documents with the ||publish|| program.

>>>FIGURE.fig-publishing-flowchart
title:: Publishing Flowchart
image:: files/images/publishing-flowchart.png
width:: 5in
<<<FIGURE

This publishing process is a lot like creating, organizing and
compiling source code into a working program.  The process of
producing a document also includes creating, organizing and compiling
(publishing) some source files.

The process involves three steps if you want to create HTML files and
four steps if you want to create a PDF file.  The HTML file creation
steps are:

+ create text source files

+ run publishing program (produces HTML files)

+ view the published HTML files in web browser

There are four steps if you want to create a PDF file:

+ create text source files

+ run publishing program (produce a LaTeX file)

+ run pdflatex to render the LaTeX file into PDF

+ view PDF file in a PDF viewer

The first step is to create the files that make up your document.
These source files might be:

- [a:SML] files

- image files

- other text files

- files in any other format or rendition you want your document to
refer to

[clearpage]

Publishing (implemented by the ``publish'' function) occurs in three
passes through the original text file(s).  The second pass is repeated
as necessary to resolve references, and create automatically generated
content:

  +----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+
  | PASS 1:        |    | PASS 2:        |    | PASS 3:        |
  |                |    |                |    |                |
  | Resolve        |--->| Resolve        |--->| Publish        |
  | included       |    | refs/labels,   |    | renditions     |
  | content        |    | get/gen data   |    |                |
  +----------------+    +----------------+    +----------------+
                           ^           |
                           |           |
                           +-----------+
                        repeat as necessary

The rest of this document teaches you the rules of [a:SML].

######################################################################

** Organizing the Input Files

Simple documents can be fully contained in a single file.  In more
complicated situations, however, you might have additional files that
get combined to create your document:

- files containing images that go in your document

- files containing text listings that go in your document

- files containing documents that are linked to your document

- files containing content that is included in your document

There are no rigid requirements for how to organize the files that go
into your document.  You can have them all in one directory or you can
organize them into other directories.

The only requirement is that you specify the path to the referenced
file as in these examples:

  image: files/images/my-picture.png

  include: ../../common/copyright.txt

  link: lectures/module_01.ppt

######################################################################

**.dependencies Dependencies

The ||publish|| program depends on some other software.  You may need
to install some additional software if the program doesn't work.

To publish PDF documents you must install a TeX/LaTeX publishing suite
that includes the ||pdflatex|| program.

To run the ||publish.pl|| Perl script instead of a binary executable
version of the program, you'll need to install some additional Perl
modules.

Here are step-by-step instructions for getting the ||publish.pl||
script working on a fresh install of Ubuntu 7.04.

step:: Install tetex: 

 sudo apt-get install tetex-bin tetex-extra latex-xcolor texlive-latex-extra

step:: Install Perl Modules:

 sudo apt-get install perl-tk libimage-size-perl libregexp-common-perl

*.sml-language The Semantic Manuscript Language

text:: If a picture is worth a thousand words why am I still writing
programs in text?

<<<EPIGRAPH

>>>EPIGRAPH

text:: Things should be made as simple as possible, but not any
simpler.

author:: Albert Einstein

<<<EPIGRAPH

[a:SML] is simple, but not too simple. It is designed with the
philosophy that simple things should be simple and complex things
should be possible.[f:sml-language:1] [a:SML] ~~enables~~ you to
describe document structures but ~~disables~~ you from prescribing
most document presentation options.  This chapter shows you the gory
details of [a:SML] summarized in [r:getting-started],
``[t:getting-started].''

Ready to write a document?  Start with this:[f:sml-language:2]:

  >>>DOCUMENT.my-doc

  title:: This is My Document

  <<<DOCUMENT

Congratulations!  You've just learned the most complicated part of
[a:SML].  [a:SML] documents are plain text and require a title. A
document is a [g:SML:division]. The title is an [g:SML:element].
Divisions start with {lit:>>>DIVISION_NAME.id} and end with
{lit:<<<DIVISION_NAME}.  The divisions allowed in your library are
enumerated in the [g:SML:ontology].

In the following sections you'll learn how to add [g:SML:paragraph]s,
[g:SML:SECTION]s, [g:SML:TABLE]s, [g:SML:FIGURE]s, [g:SML:LISTING]s,
and other document [g:SML2:structure]s.

[a:SML] is a formal [g:SML:descriptive markup] language.  That means
it has [g:SML:syntax] and [g:SML:semantics].  The syntax is fixed but
the semantics can be extended to fit the needs of your
[g:SML:library].

[a:SML] [g:SML:semantics] are ~~extensible~~.  This means you can
customize the language to describe the things you care about.  More
importantly, you can describe how the things you care about are
allowed to interrelate.  You customize [a:SML] semantics by writing
[g:SML:ontology] rules.

All documents in a [g:SML:library] share common semantics defined in a
common [g:SML:ontology].

#------------------------------
# footnotes

footnote::1: This idea is often attributed to Alan Kay, an American
computer scientist known for his early pioneering work on
object-oriented programming and windowing graphical user interface
design.

footnote::2: choose a better document identifier than ``my-doc''

######################################################################

**.syntax_semantics Syntax and Semantics

The [g:SML:Semantic Manuscript Language] has a pre-defined
[g:SML:syntax].  It has [g:SML:semantics] rules defined in a core
[g:SML:ontology].  These semantics can be extended by defining
additional ontology rules for any given library.

The syntactic components of [a:SML] are:

= [g:SML:line] = [def:SML:line]

= [g:SML:part] = [def:SML:part]

= [g:SML:string] = [def:SML:string]

= [g:SML:block] = [def:SML:block]

= [g:SML:element] = [def:SML:element]

= [g:SML:division] = [def:SML:division]

The syntactic components are used to express semantic components of
[a:SML]:

= [g:SML2:entity] = [def:SML2:entity]

= [g:SML:property] = [def:SML:property]

index:: line; part; string; block; element; division; entity;
property; syntax; semantics

######################################################################

**.data-elements Elements

index:: Elements

An [g:SML:element] is a [g:SML:block] of text that represents a
name/value pair.  For example:

  title:: Feed the Pigs

  author:: Farmer John

  type:: task

  is_part_of:: task-001 # Do Barnyard Chores

  index:: pigs

The [g:SML:syntax] for an element is:

  <element-name>:: <element-value>

Note that:

- The element ~~name~~ is everything before the double colon.

- The element ~~value~~ is everything after the double colon.

- The double colon must be on the first line of the block, meaning,
  the element ~~name~~ must be completely contained on the first line.

- The element ~~value~~ may span multiple lines.

- The element ~~name~~ must start at the beginning of the line (first
  column).

- The element name ~~cannot~~ contain spaces.

- No space is allowed between the element name and the double colon.

- Since a blank line ends an element, elements can't be any more
  complicated than a paragraph.

Elements are used to:

- represent elements of document structure (i.e. title, subtitle,
  description, glossary, acronym, index, footnote, image, step,
  include, script, plugin, var)

- describe attributes of special division like tables, figures, and
  listings (width, size, language...)

- represent entity property values

Elements are simple name/value pairs and the value of a data element
is a paragraph.  Often, this paragraph is a single line, or even a
single word or character.

Some elements have attributes.  For instance, you can use the
``column'' element to specify the width of a table column like this:

  column::1:width: 30
  column::2:width: 30
  column::3:width: 40

In this example, the column numbers (1, 2, and 3), and the parameter,
``width'' are attributes.

Elements are single-valued.  But, a division can have multiple
elements with the same name.  For instance, a document can have more
than one author.

######################################################################

**.environments-and-regions Environments and Regions

index:: Environments and Regions

[a:SML] defines special blocks of text called ~~environments~~ and
~~regions~~ to assign meaning to raw text.  Environments have
~~structural~~ meaning (like figure, listing, and table) and regions
have ~~semantic~~ meaning (like demo, exercise, and
problem). Environments are simple and regions are complicated.
Elsewhere in this document, regions are called ``items.''

~~Environments,~~ which describe structural document elements, are:

:

- table
- figure
- listing

:

- preformatted
- epigraph
- triple

:

- sidebar
- source
- attachment

:

- audio 
- video
- revisions

:

- include

---

Environments begin and end with three or more hyphens and the name of
the environment like this example table:

  >>>TABLE.tab-my-table

  title:: My Table

  :: column 1 heading
  :: column 2 heading
  ---
  : row 1 column 1
  : row 1 column 2
  ---
  : row 2 column 1
  : row 2 column 2

  <<<TABLE

~~Regions,~~ which describe semantic document elements, are:

:

- problem
- solution
- test

:

- result
- task
- role

:

- slide
- demo
- exercise

:

- keypoints
- quotation

---

A region begins with three or more greater-than signs (>) and the name
of the region.  A region ends with three or more less-than signs (<)
and the name of the region.  For example:

  >>>problem.problem-2006-01-02-001

  title:: Conflict between Emacs and screen use of C-a

  description:: In Emacs, C-a is a commonly used keystroke that takes
  you to the beginning of the line.  In screen, C-a is the prefix
  command for special screen commands (like C-a d to detach the
  terminal from the screen session).  I would prefer to use C-a for
  Emacs and use some other command (like C-\) for the screen prefix
  command.

  <<<problem

Environments are simple and regions are complicated:

- ~~Environments cannot contain other environments.~~  This means you
  can't put a table inside another table, or a figure inside a table,
  or a listing inside a table.

- ~~Regions can contain environments.~~  This means you can put a
  table (environment) in a slide (region).

- ~~Regions can contain regions.~~ Although the syntax supports this,
  I think in most cases it's a bad idea to nest regions because it
  makes the document too complicated.

Every environment and region can have a title, label, and description.
These titles are used in automatically generated lists (i.e. List of
Tables, List of Exercises, etc.) and cross references.  Labels are
used to uniquely identify the environment or region for the purpose of
references.  The descriptions, can be used anywhere in the document to
provide a one-paragraph description of the region.

In addition to titles, labels, and description, environments and
regions have ~~numerous~~ possible ~~data elements~~.  Think of these
data elements as pieces of meta-data that further describe the
environment or region.

The following sections summarize the data elements for each
environment and region.[f:environments-and-regions:1]

#------------------------------
# footnotes

footnote::1: The absolute definitive source for data elements is the
||%structure|| hash in the Perl source code of the publishing program
itself.

######################################################################

**.preamble Document Preamble

Let's start at the beginning. Every document automatically begins with
a portion of text called the preamble.  The preamble contains metadata
about the overall document like the title, author and date.  There is
no special symbol marking the end of the preamble, it simply ends with
the beginning of any non-preamble document element like a heading,
paragraph, region, environment, table, figure, etc.

The preamble is special because it is not considered an environment or
a region.  It is the beginning of the document which contains
meta-data about the document.  The document preamble ends with the
first occurrence of one of these:

:

- the beginning of a region
- the beginning of an environment
- a section heading
- an unordered list item
- an ordered list item

:

- a todo list item
- a glossary entry
- an index entry
- a table
- a quotation

:

- a paragraph
- a file data element
- an image
- a footnote

---

Here's an example of a typical preamble, in fact it's the preamble of
~~this~~ document:

  title:: Semantic Manuscript Language ([a:SML])

  subtitle:: Professional Documents Using [a:SML] [linebreak] and the
  [cmd:publish] Program

  author:: Don Johnson (drj826@acm.org)

  copyright:: 2002-2011, Don Johnson

  doctype:: book

  logo_image_center:: files/images/lost-creek-meadow.jpg

  version:: 1.2

  revision:: $Revision: 15146 $

  date:: $Date: 2013-07-07 11:42:01 -0600 (Sun, 07 Jul 2013) $

So what are all the possible elements that can go into the preamble?
Here is a complete list:

index:: preamble!data elements

= title = The title of the work.

= subtitle = The sub-title of the work.

= author = (multivalued) the author's name, or author's names.  Given
names should ~~not~~ be shortened to initials unless the author's name
is widely known in such a form.  Using a full first name helps to
ensure that a name will not be conlated with another in bibliographic
listings and library catalogs [cite:chicago, 1.11].

= editor = (multivalued) The editor's name, or editor's names.

= translator = (multivalued) The translator(s) of the work.

= publisher = The publisher's full name (imprint) should be given.

= publisher_location = The name of the city (or cities) where the
publisher's principal offices are located. [cite:chicago, 1.13]

= publisher_logo = File containing an image of the publisher's logo.

= publisher_address = The address of the publisher -- and sometimes
the addresses of overseas agents.  An address may be abbreviated,
consisting, for example, only of city and perhaps postal
code. [cite:chicago, 1.15]

= edition = In a new edition of a work previously published, the
number of the edition (e.g. Third Edition). [cite:chicago, 1.10]

= biographical_note = A brief note on the author or authors
(``author'' here includes editors, compilers, and translators),
listing previous publications and, if relevant, academic
affiliation. [cite:chicago, 1.14]

= copyright = The Copyright Act of 1989 does not require that
published works carry a copyright notice in order to secure copyright
protection.  Nevertheless, most publishers continue to carry the
notice to discourage infringement.  The usual notice consists of three
parts; the symbol [c], the year the work is published, and the name of
the copyright owner. [cite:chicago, 1.16]

= publication_year = The year of publication should correspond to the
copyright date.  From a marketing point of view, if a book is
physically available near the end of a year but not formally published
until the beginning of the next, the later date is preferred as both
copyright and publication date. [cite:chicago, 1.18]

= date = Date last modified.

= isbn = International Standard Book Number -- an ISBN is assigned to
each book by its publisher under a system set up by the R. R. Bowker
Company and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
The ISBN uniquely identifies the book, thus facilitating order
fulfillment and computer tracking of inventory.  For example, in ISBN
0-226-07522-2, the first digit, 0, tells us that the book was
published in an English-speaking country; the second group of digits,
226, identifies the publisher (in this intance the University of
Chicago Press); the third group identifies the book; and the last
digit is the check digit, which mathematically discloses any error in
the preceding group. [cite:chicago, 1.28]

= issn = International Standard Serial Number - An ISSN is assigned to
serial publications, which include journals, magazines, yearbooks, and
certain monograph series. [cite:chicago, 1.29]

= cip_data = Cataloging-in-Publication (CIP) -- Since 1971 most
publishers have printed the Library of Congress CIP data on the
copyright pages of their books.  The cataloging data printed in a book
corresponds substantially to the catalog file in the Library of
Congress.  The ~~CIP Publishers Manual~~, issued by the Cataloging in
Publication Division of the Library, provides information and
instructure for participants in the program. [cite:chicago, 1.32,
1.33]

= permissions = Statements of permission gained to quote from
copyrighted material.

= grants = Grants of financial assestance toward publication that are
made to the publisher (rather than the author) should be acknowledged
on the copyright page unless they require more space or greater
prominence, in which case they may appear on a separate page, usually
following the copyright page.  Wording should be as requested (or at
least approved) by the grantors. [cite:chicago, 1.31]

= paper_durability = Included on the copyright page is a statement
relating to the durability of the paper the book is printed on.
Acid-free paper has a longer life expectancy, and paper that is
somewhat alkaline is more durable still.  Durability standards for
paper have been established by the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI), which has issued statements to be included in books
meeting these standards. [cite:chicago, 1.35]

= dedication = The phrasing of the dedication, to be determined by the
author, is best kept simple.  There is no need to say, ``Dedicated
to.''  Such forms as ``To George,'' ``For my children,'' or ``In
memory of my mother, Mary Stephens'' are appropriate. [cite:chicago,
1.36]

= epigraph = A quotation that is pertinent byt not integral to the
text.  Epigraphs are occasionally used at chapter openings and even at
the beginnings of sections within chapters. [cite:chicago, 1.38]

= epigraph_source = The source of an epigraph is usually given on a
line following the quotation, sometimes preceded by a dash.  Only the
author's name (only the last name of a well-known author) and,
usually, the title of the work need appear.  A book epigraph should
never be annotated.  If a number should follow the source, or, to
avoid the intrusion of a number, the supplementary documentation may
be given in an unnumbered note. [cite:chicago, 1.39]

= define = (multivalued) Define keywords that control which sections

**.ordinary-structures Simple Document Structures

This section introduces the simple document structures you might use
in any document: titles, paragraphs, sections, bold, italics, lists,
footnotes, images, pre-formatted text, and so on.

######################################################################

***.document-title Document Title

index:: title!document; document title

The document title is simply the first title element encountered in
the document:[f:document-title:1]

  title:: This Is My Document Title

Normally you place the title on the first line of the text document.

#------------------------------
# footnotes

footnote::1: ~~QUESTION:~~ Why isn't __this__ example interpreted as a
title?  ~~ANSWER:~~ Because it is indented.  Indented text is
interpretted as __preformatted text__ ([ref:preformatted-text]).

######################################################################

***.paragraphs Paragraphs

index:: paragraphs

A paragraph is simply a non-indented block of text that ends with a
blank line.

  This is a paragraph. Insert a paragraph simply by adding blocks of
  text.  A blank line between two blocks of text signifies a break
  between paragraphs.

index:: paragraphs!commenting out

~~Commenting Out Paragraphs.~~ What if you to temporarily leave a
paragraph out of the published document, but you wish to keep the text
for future use?  There are a couple of ways you can `comment out' a
paragraph:

  # Any line that begins with a `#' in the first column is considered
  # a comment line.  Therefore you can `comment out' a paragraph but
  # putting a `#' at the beginning of each line.

An easier way is to enclose the paragraph in a comment division like
this:

  >>>COMMENT

  This paragraph has been `commented out' because it is enclosed
  within a comment block.  Enclosing any section of text within a
  comment block will cause the publisher to ignore it.

  <<<COMMENT

index:: paragraphs!conditional

~~Conditional Paragraphs.~~ You can make paragraphs conditional so
they appear in one version of the document but not in others.  For
instance, let's say you are writing a training document about the
Linux operating system but you need one version for Red Hat 10.0 and
another version for SuSE Linux 10.0.  Enclosing paragraphs inside
`conditional' markers indicates in which versions of the document the
text should appear:

  >>>CONDITIONAL.RedHat10

  This is a paragraph that should only appear in the Red Hat 10.0
  version of the document.

  <<<CONDITIONAL

  >>>CONDITIONAL.SuSE10

  This is a paragraph that should only appear in the SuSE 10.0 version
  of the documents.

  <<<CONDITIONAL

To specify which version of the document you wish to publish, add a
||define|| data element in the preamble of the document like:

  define:: RedHat10

index:: paragraphs!in table cells

~~Paragraphs In Table Cells.~~ You can put paragraphs inside of table
cells.  A table cell containing a single paragraph looks like this:

  : This is a table cell containing a single paragraph.  Notice the
  paragraph begins on the same line as the colon (the presence of a
  colon in the first column always indicates the beginning of a table
  cell.

If you want multiple paragraphs within the same table cell, format it
like this:

  :

  This is the first of several paragraphs within a table cell.  Notice
  that it ~~does not~~ begin on the same line as the colon.

  The space between the colon and the beginning of the first paragraph
  tells the publisher the contents of the cell should be formatted as
  separate paragraphs.

index:: paragraphs!in list items

~~Multiple Paragraphs In List Items.~~ You ~~can not~~ have multiple
paragraphs in a list item.

######################################################################

######################################################################

***.sections Sections

index:: sections; sections!headings

~~Section Headings.~~ You can organize your document into sections by
inserting section headings in the text.  A section heading is a line
that begins with one or more asterisks.  The number of asterisks
indicates the depth of the section level:

  * Top Level Section (Chapter or Appendix in a book)

  ** Sub-section

  *** Sub-sub-section

index:: sections!numbering

~~Section Numbering.~~ By default, the ||publish|| program will
automatically number the sections in the published output:

  Chapter 1 - Top Level Section (Chapter or Appendix in a book)

  1.1 Sub-section

  1.1.1 Sub-sub-section

~~Suppressing Section Numbering.~~ In ~~Options~~ -> ~~Other Options~~
pane of the graphical user interface you can un-select the ~~Number
sections?~~ checkbox to disable section numbering.  If you are running
||publish|| from the command line you can suppress section numbering
in the published document using the command-line option:

  --nosecnums

~~Limiting Section Depth.~~ If you don't want your document to have
section levels deeper than a certain depth, like 3, you can specify a
maximum section depth on the command line:

  --secnum_level=3

######################################################################

***.lists Lists

[a:SML] supports unordered (bulletized), ordered (numbered), and
definition lists.

~~Unordered lists.~~ An unordered (bulletized) list is a series of
items that begin with a hyphen (-).  The hyphen must appear in the
first column otherwise it will be interpreted as preformatted text.
The beginning of a list item ends the previous item.  Any non-list
item ends the list.  For example:

- item one

- item two

- item three

List items are designed to be simple.  You cannot place multiple
paragraphs in a list item.  You cannot put tables, figures, or
preformatted text inside a list.

~~Lists can be nested.~~  You can nest lists by indenting subordinate
list items.  For example:

- item one

- item two

  - sub-item one

  - sub-item two

  - sub-item three

- item three

~~Ordered lists.~~ An ordered (numbered) list is just like the
unordered list except each item begins with a plus sign (+).  For
example:

+ item one

+ item two

+ item three

~~Definition lists.~~ A definition (aka description) list is only
slightly more complicated.  Each item of a definition list begins with
an equal sign (=) followed by the term being defined, followed by
another equal sign and the definition of the term.  For example:

= one = item one

= two = item two

= three = item three

~~Mixed Lists.~~ You can intermingle bullet lists and enumerated
lists.

- bullet 1

- bullet 2

- bullet 3

  + number 3.1

  + number 3.2

  + number 3.3

    - bullet 3.3.1

    - bullet 3.3.2

    - bullet 3.3.3

  + number 3.4

  + number 3.5

- bullet 4

- bullet 5

######################################################################

***.footnotes Footnotes

Indicate that a footnote[f:footnotes:1] applies to your text by
inserting ||{lit:[f:<label>:<tag>]}|| where you want the footnote
indicator to appear.  The ||<label>|| is the label for the division
containing the footnote.  The ||<tag>|| is, by convention, usually a
single number or letter.  Then add the text of your footnote in a
separate paragraph like this:

  footnote::1: This is a footnote

You can put multiple footnotes in the same paragraph.  They will be
numbered in sequential order.

#------------------------------
# footnotes

footnote::1: This is a footnote

######################################################################

***.images Images

Insert an image by putting ``image:: <image-file>'' starting in column
0.

Insert a figure caption by putting ``title: <caption>''. Text after
``title:'' will be taken as the figure caption.  All caption text
must fit on one line.  Figure captions are used to build a list of
figures.  If you insert an image in your document but leave out the
figure caption, that image won't be listed in the list of figures.

image:: files/images/netcraft-activesite-usage.png

Large images will automatically scaled to about 600 pixels wide and
made clickable to bring up the full sized original image in it's own
window.  [ref:fig-knoppix-screenshot] shows an example of an image
that gets scaled because it is bigger than 600 pixels wide:

>>>FIGURE.fig-knoppix-screenshot

title:: Knoppix Linux Packs a Lot of Software Onto One CDROM

image:: files/images/knoppix-4.png

width:: 6in

<<<FIGURE

[clearpage]

######################################################################

***.preformatted-text Preformatted Text

Insert ~~simple~~ pre-formatted text by indenting each line in the
preformatted block:

  This is
  some
  pre-formatted
  text.

Insert ~~fancy~~ pre-formatted text using a ||PREFORMATTED|| division
like this:

  >>>PREFORMATTED

  +---------------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                         |
  |                         ---                             |
  |                       /     \                           |
  |                      (  * *  )                          |
  |                       |  ^  |                           |
  |                       |  o  |                           |
  |                        \___/                            |
  |                                                         |
  |                     Monkey Boy                          |
  |                                                         |
  +---------------------------------------------------------+

  <<<PREFORMATTED

When rendered the pe-formatted division (unsuprisingly) looks like
this:

>>>PREFORMATTED

+---------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                         |
|                         ---                             |
|                       /     \                           |
|                      (  * *  )                          |
|                       |  ^  |                           |
|                       |  o  |                           |
|                        \___/                            |
|                                                         |
|                     Monkey Boy                          |
|                                                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------+

<<<PREFORMATTED

######################################################################

***.ids-and-references IDs and References

~~IDs~~ mark specific divisions within a document. ~~References~~
point to the divisions marked by IDs.  For example, here's a reference
to a figure: [ref:fig-publish-window].  You specify a division's ID so
you can refer to that division.

Here's an example showing how to assign an ID to a figure then refer
to it from anywhere else in the text.  You might insert a figure into
your document that looks like this

  >>>FIGURE.fig-example-figure

  title:: My Example Figure

  image:: files/images/my-figure.png

  <<<FIGURE

Notice the ID text, ``||.fig-example-figure||.''  This assigns the ID
``fig-example-figure'' to this figure.  You can now refer to this
figure from anywhere in the text by inserting a reference:

  See [ref:fig-example-figure] for an example figure.

Follow these rules and you won't have any trouble:

- Each ID must be unique in the library.

- Don't put spaces in your IDs.

- It's a good idea (but not required) to use a three letter prefix to
  identify the type of label.  Start all section labels with ||sec-||,
  all table labels with ||tab-||, all figure labels with ||fig-||,
  etc.  This will help you keep all those labels straight in your
  head.

######################################################################

***.hyperlinks-commands-paths Hyperlinks, Commands and Paths

######################################################################

***.steps Steps

You can specify a sequence of steps like this:

  step:: Unplug your computer.

  step:: Put it in the box.

  step:: Take it back to the store.

This will be rendered like:

step:: Unplug your computer.

step:: Put it in the box.

step:: Take it back to the store.

The sequence of steps will continue until the end of the current
section, DEMO, or EXERCISE.  In other words, if you put a sequence of
steps inside a section, DEMO, or EXERCISE, step numbering will reset
to zero at the end of the section, DEMO, or EXERCISE.

There are no sub-steps.  The way to describe a nested procedure is to
use a section structure.

######################################################################

**.intermediate-structures Intermediate Document Structures

index:: divisions; document structures

Divisions can represent components of document ~~structure~~ like
tables, figures, listings, sidebars, bibliographic sources, and
preformatted text.  Divisions begin and end like
`||>>>TABLE.my-table-id||' and ||<<<TABLE|| Divisions that represent
document structures are:

- FIGURE

- LISTING

- PREFORMATTED

- SIDEBAR

- SOURCE

- TABLE

- AUDIO

- VIDEO

######################################################################

***.tables Tables

index:: tables

The ability to represent both simple and complicated tables is one of
the features that sets [a:SML] apart from alternative plain text markup
languages.

Example:

  >>>TABLE.sample-table

  title:: A Sample Table

  :: row 1 column 1 (emphasized)
  :: row 1 column 2 (emphasized)
  ---
  : row 2 column 1
  : row 2 column 2
  ---
  : row 3 column 1
  : row 3 column 2

  <<<TABLE

Here's a simple example:

>>>TABLE.osi-model-table

title:: OSI 7-layer Reference Model

:: Layer

:: Functions

---

: 7 - Application Layer

:

- Provides interface to end-user processes

- Provides standardized services to applications

---

: 6 - Presentation Layer

:

- Specifies architecture-independent data transfer format

- Encodes and decodes data; encrypts and decrypts data; compresses
data

---

: 5 - Session Layer

:

- Manages user sessions

- Reports upper-layer errors

---

: 4 - Transport Layer

:

- Manages network layer connections

- Provides reliable packet delivery mechanism

---

: 3 - Network Layer

:

- Addresses and routes packets

---

: 2 - Data Link Layer

:

- Frames packets

- Controls physical layer data flow

---

: 1 - Physical Layer

:

- Interfaces between network medium and network devices

- Defines electrical and mechanical characteristics

<<<TABLE

You can use the certain meta-data elements to specify formatting
options of tables:

>>>TABLE.tab-metadata-elements

title:: Meta-data elements that effect the formatting of tables

:: option

:: values

:: description

---

: border

: 0 or 1

: specify whether tables should have borders

---

: bgcolor

: any valid color specifier

: specify the background color of table cells

---

: cellpadding

: integer number

: specify number of pixels of padding in table cells

---

: cellspacing

: integer number

: specify number of pixels of spacing between cells

<<<TABLE

Remember, when you specify a background color using the ``bgcolor''
meta-data element, all table cells will have that background color
until you change it to something else.  In the following example, I
set bgcolor back to nothing so that the next table in the document
won't be pink:

>>>TABLE.tab-security-problems

title:: The Most Common Security Problems

::grey: Type

::grey: Problem

::grey: Explanation

---

:blue: Organizational

:blue: There's no one in charge of security

:blue: This isn't really a technical problem, but an organizational
one.  It is by far the most common problem we encounter.  Most other
problems stem from this one.  The top recommendation in nearly every
security report we do is, ``Put someone in charge of information
security.''  System and network administrators spend their days
keeping users happy by making sure computers and applications are up
and running.  Their success is measured in large part by how happy
they keep the users.  Security measures implemented by the person in
charge of security will never make users happy.

---

:blue: Organizational

:blue: Network administrators in charge of security

:blue: Network administrators have a full time job keeping systems and
applications running and users happy.  Their job performance is based
on these things rather than keeping the system secure.  Security
analysts require a different mind set and skill set to engage in
security incident prevention, detection, and response.

---

:green: Architectural

:green: Poor security architecture

:green: Many organizations we audit have a good security architecture
on paper, but a poor one in practice.  For reasons of convenience or
functionality, the security design is circumvented by punching holes
in a firewall, rogue wireless access points, and unauthorized
gateways.

---

:green: Architectural

:green: Single layer of defense

:green: Organizations need to adopt a ``defense in depth'' approach to
information security just like they do for physical security.

---

:green: Architectural

:green: No intrusion detection system

:green: Organizations that have not thought deeply about information
security think they can secure their systems simply by taking
preventative measures.  These organizations get hacked and they don't
even know it!

---

:yellow: Procedural

:yellow: Inadequate configuration control procedures

:yellow: User's hate configuration control procedures because it takes
away their freedom to do whatever they want with their computers.
Unauthorized software accounts for a significant percentage of system
vulnerabilities in most enterprises.

---

:yellow: Procedural

:yellow: Unpatched systems

:yellow: ``If it's not broke, don't fix it'' is the response we
normally get when we point out when an organization is missing
critical software patches.  Our response is, ``It's broken!''
Organizations must aggressively install software patches as they're
made available.  The vast majority of losses due to computer security
breaches could have been prevented if someone had patched a vulnerable
server.

---

:yellow: Procedural

:yellow: No incident response plan

:yellow: You will get hacked.  What are you going to do when it
happens?

---

:yellow: Procedural

:yellow: Poor (or missing) security policies

:yellow: The best security policies are useless unless they're
enforced (remember the first problem of no one in charge of security).
The most common security policy problem we find is poor passwords.
Every time we do a vulnerability assessment we audit the strength of
the organization's passwords.  We usually find that more than 80% of
user passwords are easily cracked.  On a recent assessment, we found
that 10% of all user passwords (including some domain admin passwords)
were the name of the company (easily guessed).

---

:red: Technical

:red: Software Defects

:red: All software has bugs.  Some of these bugs (like buffer overflow
conditions and format string errors) can be exploited to cause
security problems.

---

:red: Technical

:red: Misconfigured Software

:red: People make mistakes.  System and network administrators
sometimes misconfigure software.  It's not unusual to find
misconfigured firewall rules that leave certain ports open to all
traffic.  An open port is easy for a hacker to discover and exploit.

<<<TABLE

Here is a complete list of table data elements:

***.listings Listings

Example:

  >>>LISTING.lis-computer-joke

  title:: If Computers Were Like Cars...

  fontsize:: footnotesize

  file:: files/text/computer-car-joke.txt

  <<<LISTING

The result of this listing environment is:

>>>LISTING.lis-computer-joke

title:: If Computers Were Like Cars...

fontsize:: footnotesize

file:: files/text/computer-car-joke.txt

<<<LISTING

Here is a complete list of data elements that can be used in listing
environments:

index:: listing!data elements

= title = Listing caption

= label = Unique identifier

= file = a file from which to get the content of the listing

= numbers = left or right -- insert line numbers on the left of the
right of the listed text

= name = Name of a listing.  Listings that share the same name share
the same counter.  Therefore lines in the second listing with the same
name will have line numbering that picks up where the first listing
left off.

= language = Any language accepted by the LaTeX `listings' package
(see
[url:http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/listings/]).

= firstline = an integer number on which to start displaying content
from the listing.  If you've got a long file and only wish to list
lines 100 - 200, set firstline to 100.

= lastline = an integer number on which to end displaying content from
the listing.  If you've got a long file and only wish to list lines
100 - 200, set lastline to 200.

= showspaces = true or false -- represent individual spaces in the
listing as little underscore-like characters (only in PDF)

= showtabs = true or false -- represent individual tabs in the listing
as little underscore-like characters (only in PDF)

= showstringspaces = true or false -- represent individual spaces in
the listing as little underscore-like characters (only in PDF) (~~I
don't know the difference between this and `showspaces'~~)

= fontsize = from smallest to largest: tiny, scriptsize, footnotesize,
small, normalsize, large, Large, LARGE, huge, Huge (implemented via
the listings package `basicstyle' directive) I intend to add a default
`auto' option which will automatically calculate the correct fontsize
based on the widest line (number of characters) in the listing.

= stepnumber = number of lines between numbered lines (i.e. if
stepnumber is 10, put a line number every 10 lines).

= float = true or false -- If true, render the listing as a
float. (not yet implemented)

= orientation = portrait or landscape -- Specify the orientation in
which to render the PDF rendition.

***.attachments Attachments

The ~~attachment~~ environment enables you to attach any type of file
to your document.  The attachment appears in the published document
right where you put in in the text.  PDF documents enable you to
attach files which get included inside the PDF file.  In HTML
renditions you click a link to download the attachment.

Example:

  >>>ATTACHMENT.att-sample-document

  title:: Sample Document

  file:: files/sample-document.txt

  <<<ATTACHMENT

Here is what the attachment looks like in the rendered output:

>>>ATTACHMENT.att-sample-document

***.preformatted-blocks Preformatted Blocks

The ~~preformatted~~ environment is seldom used because authors
typically indent lines they want to appear as preformatted text.

Example:

      some
        preformatted
          text...

  <<<PREFORMATTED

index:: preformatted; blocks!preformatted

***.source-referencing Source Referencing

I'm defining the design of the bibliography system for the ||publish||
program.  The bibliography section will allow authors to place
bibliographical information anywhere in the document.  The publishing
process will take care of extracting and building the bibliography.

There are two parts to a citation, the citation itself which occurs in
the text like a footnote marker, and the bibliographic source
information the citation points to.

A citation look like this:

  [cite:Lamport96, 161-164]

A citation takes the form:

  [cite:<label>, <optional-text>]

The ||<label>|| must correspond to a source label.  The
||<optional-text>|| is designed to let you specify a page range,
chapter, or other set of particulars about the source being cited.
Citations are allowed to span line breaks.  Unlike LaTeX citations,
you're only allowed to cite a single source in these simple structured
text citations.

A bibliography entry looks like this:

  >>>SOURCE.Goossens94

  source_type:: book

  title:: The LaTeX Companion

  author:: Michel Goossens

  author:: Frank Mittelbach

  author:: Alexander Samarin

  publisher:: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company

  year:: 1994

  <<<SOURCE

If you want to keep all your bibliographic sources in one file (like
sources.txt), you can include that file anywhere in your text like
this:

  include: sources

The bibliographic fields are taken straight from the LaTeX book
[cite:Lamport96, 161-164] since I figure the folks who designed that
system have things pretty well figured out.

>>>SOURCE.Lamport96

source_type:: book

title:: LaTeX, A Document Preparation System User's Guide

author:: Leslie Lamport

publisher:: Addison-Wesley

year:: 1996

<<<SOURCE

In the case of LaTeX, the ||publish|| program builds the .bib file and
inserts citations where they're supposed to go.  In the case of HTML,
it inserts hyper-linked citations it creates a separate bibliography
page.

Types of bibliography source entries include [cite:Lamport96, 161-162]:

<<<TABLE

Here is a complete list of data elements used in source environments:

index:: source!data elements

= title =  The work's title.

= label = Unique identifier

= address = Usually the address of the ||publisher|| or
||institution||.  For major publishing houses, omit it entirely or
just give the city.  For small publishers, you can help the reader by
giving the complete address.

= annote = An annotation.  It is not used by the standard bibliography
style, but may be used by other styles that produce an annotated
bibliography

= author = (multivalued) The name(s) of the author(s).

= booktitle = The title of a book, a titled part of which is being
cited.  It is used only for the ||incollection|| and ||inproceedings||
entry types ; use the ||title|| field for ||book|| entries.

= chapter = A chapter (or other sectional unit) number.

= crossref = The database key (label) of the entry being
cross-referenced.

= edition = The edition of a book --- for example, ``Second''.

= editor = (multivalued) The name(s) of editor(s).  If there is also
an ||author|| field, then the ||editor|| field gives the editor of the
book or collection in which the reference appears.

= howpublished = How something out-of-the-ordinary was published.

= institution = The sponsoring institution of a technical report.

= journal = A journal name.

= key = Used for alphabetizing and creating a label when the
||author|| and ||editor|| fields are missing.  This field should not
be confused with the key that appears in the ||cite:|| command and at
the beginning of the entry.

= month = The month in which the work was published or, for an
unpublished work, in which it was written.  Use the standard
three-letter abbreviations described above.

= note = Any additional information that can help the reader.  The
first word should be capitalized.

= number = The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or
work in a series.  An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
identified by its volume and number; the organization that issues a
technical report usually gives it a number; books in a named series
are sometimes numbered.

= organization = The organization that sponsors a conference or that
publishes a manual.

= pages = One or more page numbers or ranges of numbers, such as
||42--111|| or ||7,41,73--97||.

= publisher = The publisher's name.

= school = The name of the school where a thesis was written.

= series = The name of a series or set of books.  When citing an
entire book, the ||title|| field gives its title and the optional
||series|| field gives the name of a series or multivolume set in
which the book was published.

= source = ||article||, ||book||, ||booklet||, ||conference||,
||inbook||, ||incollection||, ||inproceedings||, ||manual||,
||mastersthesis||, ||misc||, ||phdthesis||, ||proceedings||,
||techreport||, ||unpublished||

= type = The type of a technical report -- for example, ``Research
Note''.  It is also used to specify a type of sectional unit in an
||inbook|| or ||incollection|| entry and a different type of thesis in
a ||mastersthesis|| or ||phdthesis|| entry.

= volume = The volume of a journal or multivolume book.

= year = The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year
it was written.  It usually consists only of numerals, such as
||1984||, but it could also be something like ||circa 1066||.

***.audio-clips Audio Clips

The ~~audio~~ environment enables you to embed audio clips in a
document.

Example:

  >>>AUDIO.audio-morning-news

  title:: Morning News

  file:: audio/morning-news.wav

  <<<AUDIO

Audio environment data elements are:

= title = Short, description caption

= label = Unique identifier

= author = (multivalued) Author(s) of content

= duration = Duration of audio clip

= file = File containing audio clip

######################################################################

***.video-clips Video Clips

The ~~video~~ environment enables you to embed video clips in a
document.

Example:

  >>>VIDEO.video-morning-news

  title:: Morning News

  file:: video/morning-news.wav

  <<<VIDEO

Video environment data elements are:

= title = Short, description caption

= label = Unique identifier

= author = (multivalued) Author(s) of content

= duration = Duration of video clip

= file = File containing video clip

######################################################################

**.advanced-document-structures Advanced Document Structures

[a:SML] enables you to define items with semantic significance and to
describe relationships between those items.  You can define and
describe items using special text ~~regions~~.

Regions are blocks of text representing elements of !!content!! like
exercises, slides, demonstrations, etc.  Regions begin and end like
`||>>>exercise||' and `||<<<exercise||'. Elsewhere in this document,
regions are called ``items.'' Regions are:

:

- problem
- solution
- test

:

- result
- task
- role

:

- slide
- demo
- exercise

:

- keypoints
- quotation

---

Items (regions) can contain environments (e.g. you can put a table
inside an exercise) but environments cannot contain regions (e.g. you
can't put an exercise inside a table).

Regions ~~cannot~~ contain other regions.

All items may have the following data elements:

= title = A very brief description of the item

= label = A unique identifier for the item.  Don't use spaces in
labels.

= description = A one-paragraph description of the item

= revision = The current revision of the item

= date = The date the item was last changed

= author = The individual who last changed the item

= priority = A measure of the importance of the item relative to other
items

= status = A color (red, yellow, green, or grey) that represents the
degree to which the item is complete

There are two ways to set the status of an item, ~~informally~~ and
~~formally~~.  Set the ~~informal~~ status of an item using the
``||status:||'' data element like this:

  status: green

The ~~formal~~ status of an item can only be established through
testing.  Tests produce results; results contain outcomes.  Outcomes
establish the formal status of items if the ``||use_formal_status:
1||'' declaration appears in the document preamble.

The ~~priority~~ of an item is a measure of the importance of that
item relative to other items. [ref:tab-priority-values] describes the
meaning of priorities of problems, solutions, tests, and tasks.

***.keypoints Key Points

The purpose of the ~~keypoints~~ region is to place a summary of key
points at the beginning of major sections like chapters.

Example:

  >>>KEYPOINTS

  title:: Key Points Of This Course

  - The open source software development model is rapid, relentless, and
    here to stay

  - Linux is more flexible, but less integrated, than Microsoft
    Windows

  - Linux was originally designed to be expert friendly but is rapidly
    becoming user friendly

  <<<KEYPOINTS

Keypoints region data elements are:

= title = Short, descriptive caption

= label = Unique identifier

######################################################################

***.slides Slides

Slides are regions.  Start a slide with `||>>>SLIDE.my-slide-id||' and
end a slide with `||<<<SLIDE||.'

You can put unordered and ordered lists inside a slide (and they
~~can~~ be nested).

You can put tables in slides (use baretables rather than regular
tables.).

Images put inside a slide will be turned into clickable thumbnails.
In the HTML rendition, clicking on a thumbnail image in a slide will
pop up a window containing the full sized image.  Click anywhere
outside the popup image to make it go away.  Here's an example:

For example:

  >>>SLIDE.session-handshaking

  title:: Session Handshaking

  - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) establish (3-way handshake)
    - SYN
    - SYN/ACK
    - ACK

  image:: files/images/mod01_tcp_three_way_handshake.png

  - Session tear-down File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
    - FIN/ACK
    - ACK

  image:: files/images/mod01_ftp_session_tear_down.png

  - No listening port
    - SYN
    - RST/ACK

  image:: files/images/mod01_no_listening_port.png

  <<<SLIDE

Renders like this:

>>>SLIDE.session-handshaking

title:: Session Handshaking

- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) establish (3-way handshake)
  - SYN
  - SYN/ACK
  - ACK

image:: files/images/mod01_tcp_three_way_handshake.png

- Session tear-down File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
  - FIN/ACK
  - ACK

image:: files/images/mod01_ftp_session_tear_down.png

- No listening port
  - SYN
  - RST/ACK

image:: files/images/mod01_no_listening_port.png

<<<SLIDE

Slide region data elements are:

= title = Short, descriptive caption

= label = Unique identifier

= duration = Approximate duration of presentation for this slide

= author = Slide author

= copyright = Slide copyright

######################################################################

***.demos Demonstrations

The purpose of the ~~demo~~ region is to document short
demonstrations.  Demonstrations are regions (like slides).  Start a
demo with `||>>>DEMO||' and end a demo with `||<<<DEMO||.'  See the
example below.

You can put unordered and ordered lists inside a demo (and they
~~can~~ be nested).

You can put tables in demos.

You can put step lists in demos.

Images put inside a demo will be turned into clickable thumbnails.
Clicking on a thumbnail image in a demo will pop up a window
containing the full sized image.  Click anywhere outside the popup
image to make it go away.

For example:

  >>>DEMO.buffer-overflow-demo

  title:: IIS Buffer Overflow Using jill.exe

  Requirements for this demo:

  - target Windows server running vulnerable IIS server

  - jill.exe exploit program

  - netcat (nc.exe) program

  step:: Take a Windows machine running a vulnerable IIS web server:

  image:: files/images/buffer-overflow-demo-1.png

  image:: files/images/buffer-overflow-demo-2.png

  step:: Open a command shell on the attack computer and start a netcat
  listener on port 53:

  image:: files/images/buffer-overflow-demo-3.png

  step:: Attack the target by sending the buffer overflow.  To do this,
  open another command shell and launch the ``jill.exe'' program as
  shown:

  image:: files/images/buffer-overflow-demo-4.png

  step:: Wait for a connection.  You may have to hit [[Enter]] a couple
  of times in your ``listener'' terminal.  If the buffer overflow works,
  you'll get a connection and command prompt from the web server:

  image:: files/images/buffer-overflow-demo-5.png

  step:: Have fun!  You've got a command shell on the target web server.
  Now you can deface the web site, upload trojan horses, download
  interesting documents, etc.  In this screenshot, I did a directory
  listing of the C: drive and notice an interesting file named
  ``allyouserverarebelongtous.txt'':

  image:: files/images/buffer-overflow-demo-6.png

  <<<DEMO

Here's the example:

***.exercises Exercises

The purpose of the ~~exercise~~ region is to document short exercises.

Example:

  >>>EXERCISE.find-linux-kernel-version

  title:: Find the Linux Kernel Version

  The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to find the version of
  the kernel running on a Linux system (this works for all Unix
  systems).

  step:: !!Run the [cmd:uname] command.!! - Open a terminal and run the
  [cmd:uname] [[Enter]] command from the command line to find the name
  of the system.

  step:: !!Use the ||-a|| option of [cmd:uname].!! - The ||-a|| option
  to the [cmd:uname] command causes the command to find all
  information about the system.  Type [en:uname -a] [[Enter]] to see
  the gory details.

  <<<EXERCISE

When rendered this exercise looks like this:

>>>EXERCISE.find-linux-kernel-version

title:: Find the Linux Kernel Version

The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to find the version of
the kernel running on a Linux system (this works for all Unix
systems).

step:: !!Run the [cmd:uname] command.!! - Open a terminal and run the

######################################################################

***.problems Problems

Problems are things to be solved (a.k.a. requirements).  Problems
describe ~~what~~ must be done.  Solutions describe ~~how~~ things are
done.  Never confuse the ``what'' and the ``how.''

The purpose of the ~~problem~~ region is to provide a simple traceable
description of a problem.

Example:

  >>>problem.problem-2006-01-02-001

  title:: Conflict between Emacs and screen use of C-a

  solution:: solution-2006-01-02-001

  description:: In Emacs, C-a is a commonly used keystroke that takes
  you to the beginning of the line.  In screen, C-a is the prefix
  command for special screen commands (like C-a d to detach the
  terminal from the screen session).  I would prefer to use C-a for
  Emacs and use some other command (like C-\) for the screen prefix
  command.

  <<<problem

This example problem contains 4 data elements, ~~title~~, ~~label~~,
~~solution~~, and ~~description~~. [a:SML] enables you to capture a
lot of structured information about problems.  [ref:tab-problem-data]
enumerates the data elements you can use to describe problems.  In
this table, identifiers like ||P||, ||S||, and ||S1|| represent
labels.  Identifiers like <title>, <text>, and <paragraph> represent
free text.

***.solutions Solutions

The purpose of the ~~solution~~ region is to provide a simple
traceable description of a specific solution.

Example:

  >>>solution.solution-2006-01-02-001

  title:: Use C-a a instead of C-a

  problem:: problem-2006-01-02-001

  description:: Without changing the configuration of either screen or
  Emacs you can simply use C-a a in place of C-a to go to the
  beginning of a line.

  con:: This solution requires a change in editing behavior which has
  become reflexive muscle-memory over years of editing with Emacs.

  <<<solution

This example solution contains 5 data elements, ~~title~~, ~~label~~,
~~problem~~, ~~description~~, and ~~con~~. [a:SML] enables you to
capture a lot of structured information about solutions.
[ref:tab-solution-data] enumerates the data elements you can use to
describe solutions.  In this table, identifiers like ||P||, ||S||, and
||S1|| represent labels.  Identifiers like <title>, <text>, and
<paragraph> represent free text.

######################################################################

***.tests Tests

The purpose of the ~~test~~ region is to document formal tests and
make them traceable to problems, solutions and tasks.  The outcome of
tests establish formal ~~status~~ of problems and solutions.

Tests ~~formally~~ determine that status of items.[f:tests:1] For
instance, a test can formally determine whether a problem has been
solved.  Tests are often called test cases.

Tests produce results; results contain outcomes.  Each result might
represent a different solution, a different version of the same
solution, or the same solution implemented in different environments.

One test can produce many results but a result can only be the product
of one test.  In other words, you ~~can't~~ combine the outcomes from
different tests into a single result.

Tests come in many forms including, measurements, inspections, and
demonstrations.

Tests often contain procedures in their narratives.  A procedure is a
set of steps.

Example:

  >>>test

  title:: Does C-a move the cursor to the beginning of the line?

  problem:: problem-2006-01-02-001

  description:: Test to determine whether C-a moves the cursor to the
  beginning of the line.

  step:: type C-a

  step:: observe cursor

  <<<test

This example test contains 3 data elements, ~~title~~, ~~problem~~,
and ~~description~~.  [a:SML] enables you to capture a lot of
structured information about tests.  [ref:tab-test-data] enumerates
the data elements you can use to describe tests.  In this table,
identifiers like ||P||, ||S||, and ||S1|| represent labels.
Identifiers like <title>, <text>, and <paragraph> represent free text.

= title = Short, descriptive caption

= label = Unique identifier

= type = Arbitrary type identifier

= parent = The ID (label) of this test's parent. Tests can exist in
hierarchies.

= problem = (multivalued) Problem(s) related to this test.  Do
solutions solve these problems?

= solution = (multivalued) Solution(s) related to this test.  Do they
solve the related problems?

= script = (multivalued) A script that automates the test.

= tester = The name of the individual who is supposed to (or did) run
the test.

= author = The author of the test.

= owner = The person responsible for the test.

= validator = An authority who validates the suitability of the test.

= copyright = Copyright notice on this test.

= description = A one paragraph description of the test.

= level = (multivalued) Tests can result in a score called a `level.'
This is a complex data element used to define levels and the impact of
achieving each level. (a separate section will cover the complexities
of writing tests).

= question = (multivalued) Questions are complicated data elements.
Each question has a yes or no answer plus an optional comment.  The
question can include impact statements for yes and no answers.

#------------------------------
# footnotes

footnote::1: The ~~informal~~ status of an item can be declared using
the ||status:|| data element in the preamble of the item.  If the
document preamble contains the ``||use_formal_status: 1||'' directive,
item status will ~~only~~ be established by test results (outcomes).

######################################################################

***.results Results

Results are produced by tests.  The same test can produce many
results.  Each result might represent a different solution, a
different version of the same solution, or the same solution
implemented in different environments.

Each result is related to one or more specified items tested.

A result contains one or more outcomes.

Outcomes are automatically combined to determine the overall test
result status.

Example:

  >>>result

  title:: Test Results

  test:: test-2006-01-03-001

  outcome::2011-03-17:ci-000366:green: The message processor processed
  300 test messages in one (1) minute.

  <<<result

Results region data elements are:

= title = Automatically generated

= label = Unique identifier (automatically generated)

= test = The test for which this result applies

= outcome = An individual test outcome

######################################################################

****.outcomes Outcomes

An outcome records the degree to which the outcome of a test matches
the expected outcome.  It consists of (1) the date of the test, (2)
the label of the item tested, (3) a status (red, yellow, green, or
grey), (4) and a one-paragraph description of the outcome.

Test outcomes can set the status of items in the document.  If the
``||use_formal_status: 1||'' directive is included in the document
preamble, then the status of each item in the document will ~~only~~
be determined based on test outcomes.

######################################################################

****.reviews Reviews

Reviews have the exact same syntax as outcomes but do not affect the
status of items.

######################################################################

***.tasks Tasks

The purpose of the ~~task~~ region is to provide a short description
of work to be performed.

Example:

  >>>task.task-2006-01-03-001

  title:: Re-factor publish code to be object-oriented

  description:: All code that makes up the ||publish|| program is
  currently procedural code.  Several new requirements would be easier
  to satisfy if the code were structured using an object-oriented
  paradigm.

  <<<task

Task region data elements are:

= title = Short, descriptive cation

= label = Unique identifier

= type = Arbitrary type descriptor

= parent = Tasks can exist in hierarchies (called work breakdown
structures)

= problem = (multivalued) ID (label) of problem(s) related to this
task

= solution = (multivalued) ID (label) of solution(s) related to this
task

= author = The individual who wrote the description of this task

= owner = The owner of the task (i.e. the person responsible for
getting the work done)

= copyright = The copyright of the task description

= depends_on = The ID (label) of another task upon which this one
depends.  Tasks often have complex dependency relationships.

= required_by = The ID (label) of another task that requires this one.

= instance_of = The ID (label) of another task of which this is an
instance.  Tasks often have complex object inheritance relationships.
Instances inherit the attributes of the classes to which they belong.

= class_of = The ID (label) of another task for which this is a class.
Instances inherit the attributes of the classes to which they belong.

***.roles Roles

A ~~role~~ describes the duties of an individual.  An individual may
have multiple roles.

######################################################################

**.special-features Special Features

######################################################################

***.include Include

You can reuse text from other files using the ``||include||''
mechanism:

  include:: my-other-doc.txt

This will make the text of ``||my-other-doc.txt||'' part of your
current document.  This lets you modularize documents.  You can have
document components (or fragments) that are re-used in multiple master
documents.  Here are some other examples:

  include:: demos/my-hacking-demo.txt

  include:: ../../common/GPL-license.txt

Modularizing your documentation provides the following benefits:

+ Enable publishing of document parts as separate documents

+ Re-use document components across documents

+ Organize your document content for maintainability

By default, this ``include'' mechanism simply adds the external file's
text to the current document just as it appears in the external file.
However, this isn't always what you want.  What if the text in the
included file contains a section structure?  You have three options:

+ ||include: my-file.txt|| and ||include:section: my-file.txt|| -- The
title of the included text will become a top-level section in the
document.  Top-level sections in the included text will become
sub-sections.

+ ||include:subsection: my-file.txt|| -- The title of the included
text will become a sub-section of the current context.  If the
||include:subsection:|| directive occurs one of the document's
sub-sections (i.e., has a 2 asterisk heading) then the title of the
included text will be inserted as a sub-sub-section.

You can include files that include other files.  You can have up to 10
levels of included files.

######################################################################

***.comments Comment Lines and Divisions

~~Comment lines.~~ Any line that begins with '#' is interpreted as a
comment.  The '#' sign must appear in the first column otherwise the
line will be interpreted as preformatted text.

  # This is a comment.  It won't show up in the published document
  # except perhaps as an invisible HTML or LaTeX comment.

~~Comment division.~~ A whole division of text can be `commented out'
like this:

  >>>COMMENT

  This whole block of text is a comment since it occurs between the
  comment markers.  Everything inside this comment will be ignored.
  It won't show up in the published document except perhaps as an
  invisible HTML or LaTeX comment.

  <<<COMMENT

######################################################################

***.in-line-comments In-line Comments

Insert in-line comments like this:

  Line of text [# my in-line comment] containing an in-line comment.

######################################################################

***.hidden-text Hidden Text

Hide text by enclosing it within `||>>>HIDE||' and `||<<<HIDE||' lines
like this:

  >>>HIDE

  This text is hidden.

  <<<HIDE

Why not just use a comment block?  Hidden text is slightly different
from commented text.  Data elements inside hidden text are known to
the ||publish|| program and can be referenced in other parts of the
document.  So, for instance, let's say you want to hide a slide:

  >>>HIDE

  >>>SLIDE.great-slide

  title:: Great Slide Title

  description:: This great slide describes my three main points.

  - Point 1

  - Point 2

  - Point 3

  <<<SLIDE

  <<<HIDE

Even though the slide will not appear in the document, you could still
use ||{lit:[title:great-slide]}|| to recall the slide's title, and
||{lit:[description:great-slide]}|| to recall the slide's description.

>>>COMMENT

The preceding paragraph tests the publish program's ability to escape
two literal strings in the same block of text.

<<<COMMENT

You can also ``||include||'' hidden text:

  include::hide: problem-1.txt

The ``problem'' itself won't show up in the document, but you can
still refer to it's data.  This comes in handy when you want to create
a summary of items without cluttering up the document with the items
themselves.  For example, here we create a summary table of three
problems without rendering the full problems in the document:

  include::hide: problem-1.txt
  include::hide: problem-2.txt
  include::hide: problem-3.txt

  >>>TABLE.problem-summary

  title:: Summary of Problems

  : [lookup:title:problem-1]
  : [lookup:description:problem-1]
  ---
  : [lookup:title:problem-2]
  : [lookup:description:problem-2]
  ---
  : [lookup:title:problem-3]
  : [lookup:description:problem-3]

  <<<TABLE

######################################################################

***.take-note Take Note!

If you want to call attention to certain content, insert a
[[take_note]] indicator.

######################################################################

***.cross-references Cross References

You can create cross references within a document and within your
library.

: cross reference

:
  [ref:getting-started]
  [r:getting-started]

: [ref:getting-started]

---

: ID reference

:

  [id:getting-started]

: [id:getting-started]

  [pg:getting-started]

: [page:getting-started]

---

######################################################################

***.conditional-text Conditional Text

Sometimes you may have a document I want to use for multiple purpose
with slight differences for each.  The conditional text mechanism is
like the ||IFDEF|| in C.

You can make blocks of text conditional with `||???name1,name2||' at
the beginning and end of the block (three or more question marks '???'
starting at the beginning of a line and ending with a comma separated
list of names of conditionals) will start and stop the conditional
block.

For example, in the document preamble are:

  define:: rh9,knoppix

mark blocks of conditional text like:

  >>>CONDITIONAL.rh9

  This paragraph goes into the RedHat 9 version of the document, but
  not into other variations.  The '..define' statement above tells the
  ||publish|| program to include this text.

  <<<CONDITIONAL

Conditional names are defined using 'define: name' at the beginning of
the line in the document preamble (but normally near the top where
they are easily changed).

######################################################################

***.building-an-index Building an Index

Its easy to build an [i:index] for your
document.[f:building-an-index:1] An index enables readers to quickly
find information by subject.  There are two ways to add words or
phrases to the index.

index:: index!inline markup

The first way is to simply enclose it in markup like this:
||{lit:[i:term]}||.  The text of the first paragraph in this section
is:

  Its easy to build an [i:index] for your document.[f] An index
  enables readers to quickly find information by subject.  There are
  two ways to add words or phrases to the index.

Notice the markup surrounding the word ``index.'' If you look in this
document's index you should find an entry for the word ``index''
pointing to this page.

index:: index!one-line entry; index!sub-entries

The second way to add words or phrases to the index is to add a line
like this to your text:

  index:: term

You can specify multiple index terms on one line by separating them
by semi-colons:

  index:: term 1; term 2; term 3

You can specify index ~~sub-terms~~ like this:

  index:: document!structure

This will create a ``structure'' sub-entry under ``document'' in the
index.

index:: index!block of text

You can also create an index entry to indicate a whole block of text
deals with an indexed subject:

  index::begin: term

  Here are several...
  lines of text...
  about the term...

  index::end: term

#------------------------------
# footnotes

footnote::1: At the time of this writing, 2009-01-22, I haven't yet
implemented index publishing for the HTML rendition.

######################################################################

***.acronyms-list Acronyms List

It's easy to build a list of acronyms in your documents and in your
library.  A List of Acronyms will be automatically generated and
included in the backmatter of your document.  Define an acronym
anywhere in your text like this:

  acronym:: TLA = Three Letter Acronym

The syntax for an acronym definition is:

  acronym:: <acronym> {<namespace>} = <definition>

The same acronym often has multiple meanings.  Use the ``namespace''
feature to distinguish between duplicate acronyms like this:

  acronym:: TLA {theatre} = Theater of Living Arts

  acronym:: TLA {texas} = Texas Library Association

  acronym:: TLA {cheesy} = The Last Airbender

When you want to refer to an acronym in the text of your document
insert an acronym reference like:

  [a:TLA]

The syntax for acronym references is:

  [<tag>:<acronym>]

or

  [<tag>:<namespace>:<acronym>]

The value of <tag> must be one of:

= a = If this is the first reference to an acronym, include the
definition followed by the acronym in parenthesis.

= ac = same as `a'

= acs = render the ~~short~~ form of the acronym

= acl = render the ~~long~~ form of the acronym

######################################################################

***.building-a-glossary Building a Glossary

Its easy to build a [g:SML:glossary] of terms within your document. If
you've defined glossary terms in your document, the glossary will
automatically be inserted at the end of the document between the
bibliography and the index.

In the PDF rendition glossary terms are typeset in a blue italicized
font and hyper-linked to the term's definition in the glossary at the
end of the document.

In keeping with the design philosophy that simple things should be
simple and hard things possible, creating simple glossary entries and
references is simple.  More complicated glossary features are
possible.  First, let's look at a simple glossary definition and
reference.

Insert the definition of the term ``glossary'' anywhere in the
document like this:

  glossary:: glossary = A list of terms in a special subject, field,
  or area of usage, with accompanying definitions.

To indicate the definition of the term ``glossary'' can be found in
the glossary simply surround the term with ||{lit:[g:term]}|| like
this:

  Its easy to build a [g:SML:glossary] of terms within your document.  If
  you've defined glossary terms in your document, the glossary will
  automatically be inserted at the end.

######################################################################

**** Defining Glossary Entries

[ref:building-a-glossary] described the most basic glossary features,
how to define a simple glossary entry and how to reference that entry
in the text of your document.

The following additional glossary definition features are available.

+ Define a plural form of the term

+ Define multiple definitions of the same term

+ Define a sort order for the term

######################################################################

**** Glossary References

[ref:building-a-glossary] described the most basic way to refer to a
glossary term.  Here is a more complete 

:: reference type

:: SML syntax

:: Example

---

: lower case glossary term reference

:

  [g:<term>]
  [gls:<term>]

: Insert a [g:SML:glossary] term.

---

: upper case glossary term reference

:

  [G:<term>]
  [Gls:<term>]

: Insert a [G:SML:glossary] term; upper-case the initial letter of
each word.

---

: glossary definition reference

:

  [def:<term>]
  [def:<namespace>:<term>]

: A string is: [def:SML:string]

---

######################################################################

***.acronyms Building a List of Acronyms

You can build a list of acronyms by defining and using acronyms in
your document.

  acronym:: TLA = Three Letter Acronym

acronym:: TLA = Three Letter Acronym

Here's a sentence where I use the acronym [a:TLA].

######################################################################

***.generated-content Generated Content

The following blocks of content can be automagically generated by the
||publish|| program based on the content of the document:

:

- ||problem-domain-listing||
- ||solution-domain-listing||
- ||prioritized-problem-listing||

:

- ||prioritized-solution-listing||
- ||associated-problem-listing||
- ||associated-solution-listing||

---

You could think of these as special purpose tables of contents that
can be inserted anywhere you want in the document.  They are all
related to features for the documentation of systematic problem
solving.  Assuming you've inserted ``problem'' regions in your
document, you can insert a complete problem domain listing simply by
adding:

  generate:: problem-domain-listing

The same goes for the other types of generated content.  If you've
assigned priority and status attributes to your problems, you can
generate a prioritized listing of problems:

  generate:: prioritized-problem-listing

Prioritization is based on priority and status using the following
ranking system shown in [ref:tab-priority-ranking-system].

>>>TABLE.tab-priority-ranking-system

#--------------------------------------------------------------------

***.inserted-content Inserted Content

The following blocks of content can be automagically inserted by the
||publish|| program:

- narrative content of any region

Regions include problems, solutions, tests, tasks, and roles.  The
narrative portion of these regions consists of all text after the
region preamble.  Use the following syntax to insert the narrative
content of a region:

  insert:: narrative(ci-000123)

######################################################################

***.to-do-items To Do Items

Lines that begin with ``[ ]'' in the first column indicate the
beginning of a to-do item:

  [ ] means work has not started
  [!] means an urgent todo that is not yet completed
  [.] means work has started, not yet completed
  [x] means todo is done
  [-] means todo is canceled
  [?] (Don) indicates Don has a question
  [ ] (12 Sep 2002) means todo has 12 Sep 2002 deadline
  [ ] (12 Sep 2002, Don) means Don has a 12 Sep 2002 deadline

######################################################################

***.scripts Scripts

You can have the ||publish|| program run an arbitrary script for you and
insert the output in your document.  Imagine how useful this feature
is for performing automated vulnerability assessments.  You can write
a document that scripts the execution of vulnerability assessment
script, inserts the output into your document as you're publishing it!
Talk about a ``hot off the presses'' vulnerability assessment.

Scripts can be recursive.  This means the output of a script can
include a directive to run another script.  The ||publish|| program
will keep running until all script requests have been
satisfied.[f:scripts:1]

By default, the script feature is disabled.  If you have included
script requests in your document and wish to have the ||publish|| program
run them, check the ~~run scripts~~ option in the GUI or specify
||--scripts|| from the command line.

#------------------------------
# footnotes

footnote::1: Since the script mechanism could easily set up an
infinite loop, there is a safety valve.  There is a setting called
||$MAX_PASS_TWO_ITERATIONS|| that defines the maximum number of times
pass will run before the program decides you're in an infinite loop
and exits.  This is currently set to 10, but may be increased in the
future.

***.reusable-content Reusable Content

You can reuse elements of content like titles, descriptions, and
narratives.  Here is a complete list of reusable content elements
along with alternative syntaxes for reusing them

[a:SML] also has a generic ``lookup'' feature that enables you to
reuse any element of structured data, even user defined attributes:

  [lookup:<label>:<element>]

For instance, you can ``lookup'' a title like this:

  [lookup:item-label:title]

If your item contains a user defined attribute:

  >>>item.nose

  title:: My Nose

  attr:: color = red

  <<<item

you can reuse the user defined attribute using:

  [lookup:color:nose]

######################################################################

***.revision-summary Revision Summary

You can put one or more revision summaries in your document to
describe how the document has changed over time.  The revision summary
will be rendered as a table with three columns: (1) version, (2) date,
(3) summary of changes.

Here is an example:

  >>>REVISIONS

  rev:: 0.1 (1539) = 2010-10-19 = nitial draft.  Separated out the
  Crew Vetting business requirements into their own business
  requirements document, and removed all references to this document
  being a CONOPS.

*.systems-engineering Systems Engineering

>>>EPIGRAPH

text:: There's no sense being exact about something if you don't even
know what you're talking about.

author:: John von Neumann

<<<EPIGRAPH

Systems Engineering is the interdisciplinary approach governing the
total technical and managerial effort required to transform a set of
customer needs, expectations, and constraints into a product solution
and support that solution throughout the product's life. This includes
the definition of technical performance measures, the integration of
engineering specialties towards the establishment of a product
architecture, and the definition of supporting life-cycle processes
that balance cost, performance, and schedule objectives.

People spend their days solving problems.  In fact, it seems that most
of life's activity revolves around solving problems.  People who think
deep thoughts about such things say the solutions to problems can be
described as ``systems.''  There are electrical systems, mechanical
systems, software systems, systems of processes, and even systems of
systems!  You guessed it, these deep thinkers call themselves
``Systems Engineers.''

Systems Engineers solve problems systematically.  This is a good idea.
Many failed solutions can be blamed, at least in part, on
un-systematic problem solving approaches.  An important part of any
systematic problem solving method is documentation. This ||publish||
program can help you with that.

Systematic problem solvers like to divide the world into problems and
solutions.  They need to use fancy names, however so they call them
the ``problem domain'' and the ``solution domain.''  Seeing the world
in terms of well defined problems and solutions is key to a systematic
problem solving approach.  After all, if you can't define the problem,
how do you know you've solved it?

The ~~problem domain~~ is an organized description of the problem to
be solved.  The favorite problem domain organizational structure is
the hierarchy, a whole/part hierarchy.  Top level problems are broken
down into smaller and smaller problems to describe every last detail
of the problem.

The ~~solution domain~~ is an organized description of things that
solve the problem.  The favorite solution domain organizational
structure is also the hierarchy (another whole/part hierarchy). Oh the
wonderful symmetry of it all!  Top level solutions are broken down
into smaller and smaller pieces to describe every last detail of the
solution to the problem.

There are lots of things that might go into the problem and solution
domains.  In the following list, every thing in the left column
represents a type of problem to be solved, and everything on the right
represents a type of solution:

:: problem domain

:: solution domain

---

:

- requirements
- questions
- organizational tasks
- training objectives

:

- systems
- answers
- organizational processes
- training modules

---

If you think about it, everything starts falling into either the
problem domain or the solution domain.  Scary.

This ||publish|| program can help you take a systematic approach to
problem solving.  It offers the following features:

- define problems

- define solutions

- relate problems to one another in a hierarchy

- relate solutions to one another in a hierarchy

- define the priority of problems; what does it mean to some
  stakeholder if their problem isn't solved?

- define the status of problems; to what degree have they been solved?

- define the priority of solutions; what does it mean to some
  stakeholder if this solution isn't implemented or maintained?

- define the status of a solution; to what degree has it been
  implemented and successfully used to solve problems?

- trace requirements to the solutions that solve them

- trace requirements to the stakeholders who need them solved

- trace solutions to those responsible for them

- identify the cost of solutions

- trace requirements to authoritative policies that mandate they be
  solved

So what?  The ``so what'' lies in the questions you can answer once
you've pieced together this puzzle of problems and solutions:

- Why is this requirement important?

- Why is this requirement more important than this other one?

- What's problems get un-solved if I do away with this solution?

- What's the most important problem I should be working on right now?

- How much is this solution going to cost me?

- Who says we have to solve ~~this~~ problem?

The publishing program recognizes a special group of content regions
to capture project-related information: ~~problem~~, ~~solution~~,
~~test~~, ~~result~~ and ~~task~~. designed to enable systematic
documentation and traceability of problems and solutions.

######################################################################

** Problems

Problems are things to be solved (a.k.a. requirements).  Problems
describe ~~what~~ must be done.  Solutions describe ~~how~~ things are
done.  Never confuse the ``what'' and the ``how.''

The coherent set of requirements is called the ~~Problem Domain~~.
Requirements are ``coherent'' when they don't conflict with or
duplicate one another.  Requirements are organized in a hierarchy to
make them explainable.  High-level requirements are broken down into
(i.e. decomposed into) more specific requirements.

We often make a distinction between business requirements and system
requirements.

- ~~Business Requirements~~ are derived from business needs and
  compliance directives, and describe what the organization must do.
  Business requirements are allocated to the organization.  More
  specifically, they are allocated to organizational roles.  These
  roles are the ``owners'' who are responsible for ensuring their
  requirements are satisfied.

- ~~System requirements~~ are derived from business requirements, and
  are allocated to systems.  System requirements are categorized as
  (1) functional requirements, (2) non-functional requirements, and
  (3) performance requirements.

######################################################################

***.requirements-characteristics Requirements Characteristics

Requirements should have the following characteristics:

= Complete = The requirement is complete, standalone, and does not
need additional clarification or documentation to convey the problem
to be solved.

= Correct = The requirement is correctly stated. When solved, the
solution will solve the correct problem. Reviews to validate
requirements will aid in developing requirements which are correct.

= Consistent = The requirement does not duplicate or conflict with
other requirements. Reviews and simulations will aid in detecting
inconsistencies in requirements.

= Traceable = The requirement was derived from a validated source. The
source could be a Mission Need, Compliance Directive, or higher-level
requirement. In addition, if the requirement has a child, the parent
will also have traceability to that child.

= Understandable = A good requirement is a requirement that is clearly
stated, concise, and does not contain terms that may be misunderstood
by the solution designer. It is incumbent upon the solution designer
to internalize the requirements and request clarification if there is
a potential misinterpretation.

= Unambiguous = Each requirement has only one interpretation. The
language of the requirement cannot be misinterpreted by the solution
designer.

= Testable = Each requirement is subject to testing to verify the
solution solved the correct problem as stated in the
requirement. Therefore, each requirement must be testable. Testing can
be analytical, inspection, demonstration, or testing.

= Feasible = Solving problems generally has a cost/schedule
constraint. Therefore, solving a problem stated in a requirement must
conform to the cost/schedule constraint. In other words, the solution
to the stated problem (requirement) must be reasonable.

######################################################################

***.requirements-traceability Requirements Traceability

The ~~primary~~ purpose of requirements traceability is to trace
requirements from origin to fulfillment.

Requirements originate from a variety of sources: (1) authoritative
documents (statutes, regulations) that assign mission activities to
organizations, (2) authoritative documents that requires organizations
comply with standards, and (3) customer or user requests that identify
valid needs.

Requirements are fulfilled by elements of the solution domain: (1)
plans and procedures executed by organizations, and (2) systems that
perform required functions.

A ~~secondary~~ purpose of requirements traceability is to connect
requirements to a variety of information that supports planning.
Requirements are logically connected to ownership roles, test cases,
and are allocated to projects.  These connections form a sometimes
complicated ~~network~~ of connections also referred to as
requirements traceability.

Requirements traceability provides all information necessary to verify
the ~~completeness~~ of requirements, designs, and tests.  The
traceability matrices in this baseline are designed to enable
reviewers to assess completeness of requirements, designs, and tests.

Questions answered by requirements traceability are:

- Are ~~all~~ of the mission and compliance needs expressed as
  requirements?

- Do the business requirements address ~~all~~ of the mission and
  compliance needs?

- Are ~~all~~ of the business requirements justified by mission needs,
  compliance directives, valid user requests, or good practice?

- Do the system requirements address ~~all~~ of the business
  requirements?

- Are ~~all~~ of the system requirements justified by business
  requirements, or good engineering practice?

- Do the component requirements address ~~all~~ of the system
  requirements?

- Do we have test cases that cover ~~each~~ business requirement?

- Do we have test cases that cover ~~each~~ system requirement?

- Do we have test cases that cover ~~each~~ component requirement?

- Do we have a solution for ~~each~~ requirement?

- Does ~~each~~ requirement have an ``owner?''

- If a requirement owner has assigned responsibility for the
  requirement to someone else, are all ``assignees'' identified?

- Are ~~all~~ stakeholders identified for each requirement?

- Has ~~each~~ requirement been reviewed by its owner and stakeholders
  and do they ~~agree~~ with the requirement?

- Does ~~each~~ solution component have an ``owner?''

- Are ~~all~~ stakeholders identified for each solution component?

- Has ~~each~~ solution component been reviewed by its owner and
  stakeholders and do they agree with its design and implementation?

Many forms of traceability are ~~bi-directional~~.  Bi-directional
traceability means that if item ``A'' is traceable to item ``B,'' you
can discover the relationship by looking at either one.  Requirement
``A'' specifies it is traceable to requirement ``B'' and requirement
``B'' specifies it is traceable to requirement ``A.''

######################################################################

****.whole-part-traceability Whole/Part Traceability

The most basic form of requirements traceability is the ~~whole/part
hierarchy~~.  Requirements should be carefully organized into a
whole/part hierarchy to make the requirements easy to explain.

The primary benefit of organizing requirements into a hierarchy is
~~explain-ability~~.  The best way to make requirements understandable
is to start explaining them at a high level and to systematically
``drill'' deeper to reveal more detail as necessary.

Another benefit of organizing requirements into a whole/part hierarchy
is to enable requirements analysts to recognize and avoid duplicate
and overlapping requirements.

This engineering baseline presents the whole/part requirements
hierarchy three ways: (1) the expandable/collapsible tree shown in
[ref:fig-whole-part-req-hierarchy], (2) the traceability matrix shown
in [ref:fig-req-traceability-matrix], and (3) within detailed
requirements descriptions shown in [ref:fig-requirement-parts] and
[ref:fig-requirement-parents].

requirements traceability matrix.  Notice the ``parts'' column in the
middle of the matrix and the ``up'' link in the upper right corner.

children (i.e. parts) and each ``child'' requirement must identify its
parent.

description:: All requirements except the top-level requirements in a

heritage all the way up to their top-level requirements.

<<<FIGURE

######################################################################

****.directives Directives

Requirements should be traceable to authoritative directives.  When a
requirement exists because an authority directs it, that requirement
should be formally traceable to that authoritative directive.

Capturing traceability to a directive is as easy as this:

  directed_by:: NIST 800-53, CM-2

If you want bi-directional traceability to directives, first capture
the directive as a problem (i.e. requirement) then use the problem
label to establish traceability:

  directed_by:: rq-000001

Tracing requirements to the directives makes it possible to
~~justify~~ those requirements.  When getting the resources necessary
to design solutions, the question is inevitably asked, ``why is this
requirement important?''  Tracing the requirement to an authoritative
directive makes it possible to answer that question.

The same requirement can be directed by multiple authorities.

######################################################################

****.requests Requests

Sometimes the origin of a requirement is a request (e.g. ``trouble
ticket,'' ``problem report,'' etc.).  In this case, the requirement
should be made traceable to the request.  The benefit of tracing the
requirement to the originating request is to preserve the original
context of the stated need.  You can go back later and ask the
requester to clarify their need or to find out if your solution meets
their need.

It's easy to confuse requests and requirements.  ~~Anyone~~ can make a
request.  Requests come streaming in and someone must figure out what
to do with them.  Several people might make the same request.  Someone
might request a feature already implemented by the system but they
don't know how to use it.  Requests are messy.  Taken all together,
requests form a disorganized jumble of raw user needs.

Requirements, on the other hand, should be complete, correct,
consistent, traceable, understandable, unambiguous, testable,
feasible, and well organized into a baseline which is only changed in
an orderly, systematic way.

######################################################################

****.derived-requirements Derived Requirements

There must be a reason for each requirement.  If not directed by an
authoritative source, a requirement is likely derived from another
that is.

Component requirements are derived from system requirements.  System
requirements are typically derived from business requirements.
Business requirements are often derived from mission needs.

The benefit of documenting how requirements are derived is the ability
to justify requirements.  Requirements must be justified because
satisfying them costs resources.

######################################################################

****.test-cases Test Cases

Requirements must be traceable to the verification and validation test
cases that prove they are solved and solved in the correct way.

######################################################################

****.solutions-traceability Solutions

Requirements must be traceable to the solutions that solve them.

######################################################################

****.requirement-owners Requirement Owners

Business requirements define what an organization must do.  Every
business requirement should be traceable to the organizational role
that owns it.  That is, the role responsible for ensuring the
requirement is met.  Business requirements are ~~allocated~~ to
organizational roles.

This engineering baseline treats roles as first-class objects.
Traceability between business requirements and roles therefore is
bi-directional.  If you look at a business requirement you will see
who owns it and if you look at a role you will see a list of all
business requirements owned by that role.

Ownership of system requirements is slightly more complicated.  System
requirements are ~~allocated~~ to systems and system components.  The
owner of a system requirement is the owner of the system or component
to which the requirement is allocated.

######################################################################

****.requirement-stakeholders Requirement Stakeholders

There may be people with an interest in getting a requirement met who
are not the owner of the requirement.  These people are known as
stakeholders.

######################################################################

****.requirements-reviews Requirements Reviews

Requirements must be reviewed by requirement owners and stakeholders.

######################################################################

****.requirements-verification-audits Requirements Verification Audits

Requirements must be verified.  Requirements verification audits must
be documented.  The verification documentation should be traceable to
the requirement.

######################################################################

***.requirements-attributes Requirements Attributes

We describe requirements using the following attributes:

= Title = A short, descriptive title for the requirement

= Description = A couple of sentences that describe the problem to be
solved

= ID = A unique identifier used to track each requirement and to make
requirements traceable

= Type = The type of requirement described -- use any descriptive text

= Priority = The importance to the organization's mission of solving
the requirement (critical, high, routine, or low) -- See
[ref:tab-priority-values] for definitions of these priority values

= Status = The extent to which the requirement has already been solved
(green, yellow, or red) -- See [ref:tab-status-values] for definitions
of these status values

= Owner = The individual responsible for solving the problem

= Stakeholder = One or more individuals interested in solving the
requirement

= Author = The individual who wrote or last changed the requirement

= Validator = An individual in a position of authority who has
validated the requirement is one that must be solved; or, a board --
Configuration Control Board (CCB), Engineering Review Board (ERB),
Technical Review Board (TRB), or Requirements Review Board (RRB) --
that validates the requirement

= Directed by = One or more authorities (individuals or documents)
that direct that the requirement be solved

= Parents = The chain of requirements that traces through the
whole/part hierarchy to the top-level requirement

= Parts = Sub-requirements

= Solutions = Elements of the solution domain like configuration items
(CIs) or procedural documentation that do, or could, satisfy this
requirement either in whole or in part -- requirements get
~~allocated~~ to solutions to ~~assign responsibility~~ for solving
requirements so project managers (CI owners) know which requirements
they must solve

= Release = The specific release number of a solution designed to
solve the requirement -- requirements get ~~allocated~~ to specific
releases of a solution so users know when to expect the requirement to
be solved

= Requests = Tickets (user requests, problem reports) related to this
requirement

######################################################################

*** Requirements Reviews

Requirements are periodically reviewed.  The purposes of reviewing
requirements are:

= Identify Requirement Type = Identify each requirement as either a
business requirement (something an organization must satisfy) or a
system requirement (something a system must satisfy).

= Ensure Common Understanding = Ensure all stakeholders have a common
understanding of each requirement.

= Ensure Completeness = Ensure that sets of requirements completely
describe the problem to be solved.  Also, ensure each requirement is
individually complete.  That means the requirement is self-explanatory
and does not need additional clarification or documentation to convey
the problem to be solved.

= Ensure Simplicity = Ensure requirements are written in a simple,
understandable way.  Each requirement should have only one
interpretation.  Clarify requirements that could possibly be
interpreted in more than one way.  Use examples if possible.

= Ensure Testability = Ensure each requirement is subject to testing
to verify the solution solved the correct problem as stated in the
requirement.  Each requirement should identify the test method for
verifying the requirement. Test methods include: (1) analysis, (2)
inspection, (3) demonstration, and (4) testing.

= Ensure Feasibility = Ensure satisfying each requirement is
feasible. Solving requirements generally has cost and schedule
constraints.  Solving the problem stated by each requirement must be
reasonably feasible.

= Ensure Correct Structure = Ensure all stakeholders agree with the
requirements structure.  The requirements structure is the
hierarchical organization of the requirements.  The requirements
structure is established by identifying the parent of each
requirement.

= Ensure Consistency = Ensure each requirement is not inconsistent
with other requirements.  Be sure no requirement duplicates another.
Be sure requirements do not conflict with one another.

= Identify Justification = Ensure each requirement is justified as
strongly as possible.  The strongest possible justification for a
requirement is a ``directed by'' statement that identifies an
authoritative source that directs the requirement be met.  The next
strongest possible justification is a non-authoritative ``directed
by'' statement.  If no policy directs satisfaction of the requirement,
explain why the requirement is necessary.

= Identify Owner = For business requirements, that is, requirements
that state what an organization must do, identify the ``role'' that
owns the requirement.  The requirement owner is the role responsible
for ensuring the requirement is satisfied.

= Identify Priority = Identify the priority of each requirement.  The
priority expresses the importance to the organization's mission of
satisfying the requirement: (1) critical = mission failure if not
satisfied, (2) high = significant mission impact if not satisfied, (3)
routine = mission impact if not satisfied, (4) low = minimal mission
impact if not satisfied.

= Identify Stakeholders = Identify all stakeholders with an interest
in the satisfaction of the requirement (i.e. who needs this?).

= Establish Requirement Traceability = Ensure each system requirement
is derived from a business requirement or is part of another system
requirement.

= Establish Solution Traceability = Ensure each requirement is
bi-directionally traceable to solutions designed to satisfy the
requirement.

= Establish Test Case Traceability = Ensure each requirement is
bi-directionally traceable to test cases designed to verify
requirement satisfaction.

= Establish Request Traceability = Ensure each requirement is
traceable to original stakeholder requests.  This traceability is
designed to answer the questions, ``How was this requirement
identified?'' -- ``Who identified this requirement?'' -- ``When was
this requirement identified?''

*.using-emacs Using Emacs to Edit SML Files

index:: Emacs

[a:SML] is based on Emacs' outline mode.  I find that editing [a:SML] files in
Emacs is very quick and easy.  Emacs is a free, open source editor
available for windows from:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html

Emacs is also available for Unix and Linux, and is probably already
installed if you're using one of those operating systems.

Emacs is easy to use as a plain text editor.  It has pull down menus
for editing functions (cut, copy, paste, etc).  Those who learn Emacs'
advanced editing capabilities (like macros) can edit text with
incredible speed and power.

######################################################################

**.emacs-variables Adding an Emacs mode directive to an SML file

If you ~~do~~ choose to use Emacs, you might want to put the following
line at the top of each [a:SML] file to force Emacs into outline mode
when it opens the file:

  -*- mode: outline -*-        

This line won't show up in your published document because the
publishing program ignores lines containing the ``-*-'' string starting
in the first column.

If you don't want to clutter up the beginning of your document with
that ugly looking outline mode declaration, you can instead place a
set of emacs variable declarations at the end of your document like
this:

  # Local Variables:
  # mode: outline
  # mode: fill
  # coding: us-ascii
  # fill-column: 70
