* Introduction

This is the Test and Evaluation Document (TED) for the Structured
Manuscript Language (SML) data format and SML application library.

The purpose of this document is to:

+ describe the [g:SML:unit test case]s that verify [g:IEEE:unit]s work
  properly

+ describe the verification [g:IEEE:test case]s that verify
  [g:SML:requirement]s are satisfied

+ report [g:SML:unit test] results that demonstrate units are working
  properly

+ report [g:IEEE:verification] test results that demonstrate
  requirements are satisfied
