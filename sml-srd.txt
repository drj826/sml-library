* Introduction

The purpose of this [a:SML2:SRD] is to communicate a common
understanding of ~~what~~ the [a:SML] software does (or is supposed to
do). Reading this document will give you a comprehensive understanding
of the purpose of [a:SML] software.

The requirements are organized into [g:SML:functional requirement]s,
[g:SML:non-functional requirement]s, and [g:SML:technical
requirement]s:

+ [id:rq-000104] [lookup:title:rq-000104]

+ [id:rq-000111] [lookup:title:rq-000111]

+ [id:rq-000199] [lookup:title:rq-000199]
