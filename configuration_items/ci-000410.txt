description:: SML::Library is the central class in the design. A
library contains a collection of related [g:SML:DOCUMENT]s.  These
documents may describe entities, their properties, and how they relate
to one another.  A library has an [g:SML:ontology], a set of rules
that declares the entities that exist and how they may be related.
