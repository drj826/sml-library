title:: Template System

type:: software

description:: The template system defines how document renditions are
produced.  Templates correspond to part names and define the format
for each part.  Document content is first parsed from SML text into an
object model and then is merged with the formats defined in the
templates to produce final document renditions.  Templates are
organized by rendition and style.
