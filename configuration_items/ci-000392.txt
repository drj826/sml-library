description:: The SML::Section class represents a document section.
Sections exist in sequences and cannot be nested.  This may seem
counterintuitive.  A section may not contain another section? What
about sub-sections?  Technically, sections don't ~~contain~~
sub-sections.  Sections have properties like depth and number that
make them appear nested, when in fact they are not.
