description:: The Reasoner.pm module implements the SML::Reasoner
class (a semantic reasoner).  A semantic reasoner, reasoning engine,
rules engine, or simply a reasoner, is a piece of software able to
infer logical consequences from a set of asserted facts or axioms. The
notion of a semantic reasoner generalizes that of an inference engine,
by providing a richer set of mechanisms to work with. The inference
rules are commonly specified by means of an ontology language, and
often a description language. Many reasoners use first-order predicate
logic to perform reasoning; inference commonly proceeds by forward
chaining and backward chaining [wp-semantic-reasoner] The
{lit:SML::Reasoner} class is used to validate higher-level document
semantics like business rules to which engineering documents must
conform.
