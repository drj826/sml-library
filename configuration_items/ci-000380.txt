description:: The SML::Reasoner class is a semantic reasoner.  A
semantic reasoner, reasoning engine, rules engine, or simply a
reasoner, is a piece of software able to infer logical consequences
from a set of asserted facts or axioms. The notion of a semantic
reasoner generalizes that of an inference engine, by providing a
richer set of mechanisms to work with. The inference rules are
commonly specified by means of an ontology language, and often a
description language. Many reasoners use first-order predicate logic
to perform reasoning; inference commonly proceeds by forward chaining
and backward chaining [wp-semantic-reasoner] The {lit:SML::Reasoner}
class is used to validate higher-level document semantics like
business rules to which engineering documents must conform.
