priority:: routine

type:: data format

description:: The data format shall minimize document
[g:SML:presentation] markup.  Presentation markup is markup that
controls how content is presented (i.e. bold, italics, big, small,
etc.). The primary purpose of this requirement is to limit authors
capability to adjust presentation. In other words, ~~deny~~ authors
the ability to specify the ~~style~~ or ~~appearance~~ of their
content.

Authors should focus on creating content instead of fiddling with
document presentation.  Modern documents are often published to
multiple formats and authors often do not control how their content is
presented to readers.

is complete and understandable (Don Johnson).

review::2015-12-13:rq-000005:red: I've changed my mind.  Now I think
this requirement is horrible.  It is poorly written, and I don't
understand what it means. (Don Johnson)

outcome::2015-12-12:rq-000005:green: This requirement is complete and
understandable (Don Johnson).

outcome::2015-12-13:rq-000005:yellow: This requirement is partially
complete and partially understandable. Elaborate on the meaning of
`presentation markup' to make this green. (Don Johnson)
