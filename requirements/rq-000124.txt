priority:: routine

type:: data format

associated:: rq-000048

description:: The data format shall represent special symbols.  This
requirement serves as a container for those symbols.  Many useful
symbols are not directly encoded in 7-bit ASCII.  Since [id:rq-000048]
constrains the data format's encoding to 7-bit ASCII the data format
must define alternate representations for these symbols.
