in a document into data structures for further processing by other
software functions.

Resolving several SML constructs requires parsing an SML document to
be an iterative process. Therefore, the 'gather data' function may be
repeated many times.

- Throw an exception if the parsing process causes a pre-defined
  maximum number of iterations to be exceeded.

- Ensure that data gathered during previous iterations of the 'gather
  data' function do not cause the parsing function to store inaccurate
  document data.

- Ignore data within comment divisions.

- Capture comment division content as a pre-formatted block.

- Ignore comment lines.

- Ignore inline comments.

- Gather all data withing conditional divisions.  Resolution of
  conditional divisions is performed by the rendering function, not
  the parsing function.

- Gather table content metrics to enable computation of table layout
  (number of columns, amount of content in each cell)

- Establish an automatically generated ID for each division to ensure
  each division has an ID even if no ID was specified by the author.

- Detect author-supplied division IDs.

- Replace the automatically generated IDs with the author-supplied
  IDs.

- Assign lines to blocks.

- Assign lines to divisions.

- Assign blocks to divisions.

- Assign divisions to divisions.

- Create an array of blocks that comprises the document.

- Create an array of divisions that comprises the document.

- Identify blocks that should be considered 'pre-formatted'.

- Throw an exception on discovering an improperly nested conditional
  division.

- Throw an exception on discovering the beginning of a region while in
  an environment.

- Recognize the ends of preambles (document, region, environment).

- Throw an exception on discovering the beginning or ending of an
  undefined region.

- Throw an exception on discovering the end of a region without being
  in that region.

- Throw an exception on discovering the end of an environment without
  being in that environment.

- Recognize section headings.

- Throw a warning on discovering a section heading while in a region
  or environment.

- End any previous section division upon discovering a section
  heading.

- Recognize blank lines.

- End current element on discovering a blank line and not in a
  pre-formatted block.

- Recognize the end of bare tables.

- Recognize preamble elements.

- Throw a warning if the ontology does not allow a preamble element in
  the division in which it was discovered.

- Recognize universal elements.

- Throw a warning if the document ends while in a region or
  environment.
