title:: Validate Infer-Only Properties

is_part_of:: rq-000106

type:: functional

description:: The software shall enable a user to validate that
`infer-only' properties are ~~not~~ explicitly declared.  The ontology
specifies that certain properties are `infer-only' properties,
meaning, they may only be implied by the application and may ~~not~~
be explicitly declared in a document.  The purpose of disallowing
explicit declaration of certain properties is to prevent conflicting
property declarations.
