presence of document syntax errors shall ~~not~~ cause the software to
crash.  The software shall emit an ~~error~~ upon encountering a
document syntax error that prevent the software from producing ~~any~~
meaningful output.  The software shall emit a ~~warning~~ upon
encountering a document syntax error that ~~may~~ indicate that
document output will not be what the document author intended.

The software should emit an ~~error~~ upon encountering a syntax
problem that prevents the software from producing the document.

The software should emit a ~~warning~~ upon encountering a syntax
problem not severe enough to prevent the software from producing the
document, but significant enough to alter the intended document
output.
