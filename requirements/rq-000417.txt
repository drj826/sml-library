title:: Define the Syntax for a Status Reference String

is_part_of:: rq-000407

type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
an inline status reference.  The ``status'' of an entity represents
the degree to which the entity is complete.  The status reference will
enable authors to refer to the status of any entity from anywhere in
the library.  The syntax must also enable an author to directly
specify a status value (green, yellow, red, or grey).
