description:: The software shall read files from persistent storage
into memory.  The purpose of reading files is to retrieve data from
persistent storage so that other software functions can validate the
data, transform the data, and generate related data.  The software
must store the data in memory in a way that enables other software
functions to report the file and line number of detected problems.
