title:: Enable a User to View the Completeness of a System

type:: functional

is_part_of:: rq-999999

description:: The software shall enable a user to view the
completeness of a system. The completeness of a system is typically
expressed via ``traceability'' views that show relationships between
requirements, solutions, and tests including the degree of
completeness of those requirements, solutions, and tests.

index:: rq-000444

In a single view the software shall enable the user to answer the
following questions:

+ Are the requirements related to some function complete?

+ Have those requirements been allocated to solutions?

+ Have those solutions been completely implemented?

+ Have tests been established to prove the allocated solutions meet
  the requirements?

+ Have the tests been executed to prove the allocations have been
  satisfied?

The software shall present a view that answers these questions without
requiring the user to click to another view.
