description:: The [g:SML:ontology] shall permit the user to configure
the allowed properties of entities. This is a `configurability'
requirement.  The purpose of this requirement is to ensure the
solution does ~~not~~ hard-code allowed entity properties into the
software solution but instead enables users to configure custom entity
properties in their own libraries.

index:: [id:rq-000349]

For instance, in a library intended to hold systems engineering
information, a user might define entity types:

- entity: requirement

  - property: priority

  - property: status

  - property: stakeholder

- entity: configuration item

  - property: owner

  - property: cost

  - property: version

The definitions of these and other entity properties should ~~not~~ be
``baked in'' to the software product but instead the software should
permit the user to configure the entity properties allowed in a
library.
