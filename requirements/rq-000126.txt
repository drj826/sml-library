description:: The software shall enable a user to render
[g:SML:document]s from [g:SML:Semantic Manuscript Language] (SML) to
finalized [a:SML].  That might seem odd.  It means the publishing
function shall produce SML documents with the following functions
completed: (1) resolve `includes', (2) run scripts, (3) resolve
`insert' requests, (4) substitute variables, (5) resolve `lookup'
requests, (6) fill in templates, and (7) resolve requests to generate
content.
