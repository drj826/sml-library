title:: Define the Syntax for a Property Reference String

type:: data format

is_part_of:: rq-000407

description:: The data format shall define the syntax for a property
reference string.  The purpose of a property reference string is to
``look up'' any property value in the library and re-use it in another
location.  For instance if you have a table description you wish to
show in other locations you should have the ability to ``look up'' the
description property of the table.
