title:: Define the Syntax for a Property Value Lookup Reference String

type:: data format

is_part_of:: rq-000407

description:: The data format shall define the syntax for a property
value lookup reference string.  The purpose of a property value lookup
reference string is to ``look up'' any property value in the library
and re-use it in another location.  For instance if you have a table
description you wish to show in other locations you should have the
ability to ``look up'' the description property of the table. This
maximizes document maintainability by giving authors the capability to
define content in only one location and reuse it in many.
