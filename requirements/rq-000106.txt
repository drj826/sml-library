description:: The software shall enable a user to validate first-order
document [g:SML:semantic]s.  First-order document semantics are
expressed as rules (axioms) in a [g:SML:library]'s
[g:SML:ontology]. Validate that entities with [g:SML:semantic]
significance conform to a specified [g:SML:ontology].  More
specifically, valid entities must: (1) have all required properties,
(2) not have any dis-allowed properties, (3) have valid relationships
with other entities, that (4) not have `imply-only' properties stated
explicitly. Warn the user of invalid semantics with a notification
that includes an error description, file, and line number.

The adjective ``first-order'' distinguishes first-order logic from
higher-order logic in which there are predicates having predicates or
functions as arguments, or in which one or both of predicate
quantifiers or function quantifiers are permitted.[f:rq-000106:1]
