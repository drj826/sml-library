title:: Permit Configuration of Allowed Entity Types

is_part_of:: rq-000183

priority:: routine

type:: non-functional

description:: The [g:SML:ontology] shall permit the user to configure
the [g:SML2:entity] types allowed in a [g:SML:library].  This is a
`configurability' requirement.  The purpose of this requirement is to
ensure the solution does ~~not~~ hard-code entity types into the
software solution but instead enables users to configure custom entity
types in their own libraries.

index:: [id:rq-000349]

For instance, in a library intended to hold systems engineering
information, a user might define entity types:

- entity: requirement

- entity: configuration item

- entity: test cases

- entity: test data

- entity: user roles

The definitions of these and other entities should ~~not~~ be ``baked
in'' to the software but instead the software should permit the user
to configure the entity types allowed in a library.
