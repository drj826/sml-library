type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to identify and
represent document content as the description of tasks.  A task
describes work to be performed.  The purpose of identifying content as
a task is to make that task semantically traceable to other elements
of content (like roles and problems), to make the content re-usable,
and to enable special listings of tasks.
