title:: Permit Entity Properties to be Declared in a CSV File

is_part_of:: rq-000006

type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent a
`csvfile' statement to include structured data from comma-separated
value (CSV) files.  The purpose of including a CSV file is to make the
contents of the file available for re-use via the `lookup' function.
Values from a CSV file will be available for lookup using a key/name
combination.  The CSV file is structured with key values in the first
column and name values as column headers so that the lookup becomes
simply a row/column lookup.

index:: rq-000348

Here, for instance, is an example CSV file named `net-config.csv' from
which you might wish to re-use data in other parts of a document:

  ENTITY,    IP,       MAC
  ci-000001, 10.1.2.3, CO:F8:DA:33:3A:D3
  ci-000002, 10.1.2.4, CO:F8:DA:33:3A:D4
  ci-000003, 10.1.2.5, CO:F8:DA:33:3A:D5

The data format should enable the user to make this data available for
use in a document.  For instance, the data format might define a
syntax like:

  csvfile:: path/to/net-config.csv

Then data from the CSV file might be re-used via a `lookup' mechanism
such as:

  [lookup:ci-000001:IP]
