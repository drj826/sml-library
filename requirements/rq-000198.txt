title:: Represent Allocations

priority:: routine

is_part_of:: rq-000195

type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to identify
and represent document content as allocations.  An allocation is a
pairing of a problem and a solution.  It is an assertion that the
solution shall solve the problem.  Allocations are limited to a single
problem and a single solution. The purpose of identifying content as
an allocation is to make the content re-usable, to enable special
listings of allocations, and to enable automatic reasoning about
allocations.
