title:: Represent an Allocation

is_part_of:: rq-000373

type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to identify
and represent document content as an allocation.  An allocation is a
pairing of a requirement and a solution.  It is an assertion that the
solution shall solve the requirement.  Allocations are limited to a
single requirement and a single solution. The purpose of identifying
content as an allocation is to make the content re-usable, to enable
special listings of allocations, and to enable automatic reasoning
about allocations.
