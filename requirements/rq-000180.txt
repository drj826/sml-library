description:: The software shall resolve included hidden text.  The
[a:SML] data format enables authors to include the content of an
external file as hidden text, meaning, the text should be included but
not shown in the rendered document.  This enables authors to re-use
properties of the hidden text without displaying the full text of the
included file.
