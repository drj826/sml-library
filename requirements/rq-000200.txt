description:: The system shall enable a user to validate engineering
document semantics.  The semantics of engineering documents are
expressed as rules or axioms to which entities in the document must
conform.  Example axioms include: (1) each system requirement must be
derived from a business requirement, (2) an `allocation' pairs one
system requirement to one system configuration item, (3) each
verification test case verifies an allocation, that is, that the
implemented configuration item satisfies the allocated requirement(s).
