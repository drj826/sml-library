type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
assertions.  An assertion is a statement claiming a fact is true.  The
statement is expressed as a subject-predicate-object triple.  The
purpose of this requirement is to enable authors to use the data
format to capture simple assertions that can be used by a reasoning
application to automatically look for inconsistencies via formal
logic.
