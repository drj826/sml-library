type:: data format

associated:: rq-000015

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
an image.  This capability allows authors to insert an image into a
document.  Note that an image is different than a figure.  A figure
has a title and description and can be cross referenced using a unique
identifier.  An image, on the other hand, is simply a picture inserted
as document content with no other meta-data.  Images have no meta data
elements.
