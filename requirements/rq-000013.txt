description:: The data format shall define the syntax for an image
element.  The purpose of an image element is to insert an image into a
document.  An image is different than a figure.  A figure has a title
and description and can be cross referenced using a unique identifier.
An image, on the other hand, is simply a picture inserted as document
content with no other meta-data. The syntax shall capture the filespec
for the image file.
