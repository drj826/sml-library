priority:: routine

is_part_of:: rq-000372

type:: data format

associated:: rq-000015

description:: The data format shall define the syntax for an image.
This capability allows authors to insert an image into a document.
Note that an image is different than a figure.  A figure has a title
and description and can be cross referenced using a unique identifier.
An image, on the other hand, is simply a picture inserted as document
content with no other meta-data.  Images have no meta data elements.
