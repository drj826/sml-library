description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
``update triggers.'' The update trigger function is a solution to a
problem created by the ``include'' mechanism: a change to an included
file should trigger an update to the containing file. An ``update
trigger'' is a tag containing content automatically updated by a
software parsing or publishing function, introducing a change to the
containing document when the included document is updated.  The data
format must implement three types of update triggers: (1) revision,
(2) author, and (3) date.
