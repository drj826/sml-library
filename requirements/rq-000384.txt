title:: Define the Syntax for a Definition Element

type:: data format

is_part_of:: rq-000372

description:: The data format shall define the syntax for a definition
element.  The purpose of a definition element is to declare a term and
it's related definition.  This syntax might be used for multiple
different semantics such as glossary entries, acronym list entries,
and variable definitions. The syntax shall capture the defined term,
an optional namespace, and the term definition.  The namespace is a
string of characters that disambiguates the definition from other
definitions of the same term.

index:: rq-000384; definition; element!definition

outcome::2016-03-05:rq-000384:red: This requirement is complete,
however, I'm not convinced it is necessary.  The syntax that satisfies
this requirement is not used anywhere in the code. More specific
syntax for glossary, acronym, and variable definitions are used
instead. (Don Johnson)
