title:: Implement Core SML Semantics

is_part_of:: rq-000170

priority:: routine

type:: technical

description:: The software shall implement data structures that define
core SML semantics. The purpose of this requirement is to enable
automatic validation of document semantics.

index:: [id:rq-000118]; semantics!SML

Core semantics are those that would apply to ~~any~~ document as
opposed to specialized semantics that would apply to entities in a
special purpose library. Core semantics pertain only to document
[g:SML2:structure]s.
