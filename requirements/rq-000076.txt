type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
traceability relationships between specified elements of content.
``Traces'' between content elements are simple
subject-predicate-object assertions that declare something to be true.

index:: [id:rq-000076]; traceability

The data format must have the capability to represent specific
assertions.  Items (problems, solutions, tests, results, tasks, roles,
exercises, demonstrations, slides, quotations, and key points) may be
the subject of an assertion.  The following tables, one for each item,
enumerate the assertions the data format must represent for each item.
