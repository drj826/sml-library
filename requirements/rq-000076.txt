title:: Represent a Traceability Relationship

priority:: routine

is_part_of:: rq-000009

type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent a
traceability relationship between specified parts of content.
``Traces'' between parts are simple subject-predicate-object
assertions that declare something to be true.

index:: [id:rq-000076]; traceability

The data format must have the capability to represent specific
assertions.  Items (problems, solutions, tests, results, tasks, roles,
exercises, demonstrations, slides, quotations, and key points) may be
the subject of an assertion.  The following tables, one for each item,
enumerate the assertions the data format must represent for each item.
