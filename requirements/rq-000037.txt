type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to identify
and represent document content as the description of a role.  A role
describes the position a person holds in an organization.  The purpose
of identifying content as a role is to make that role semantically
traceable to other elements of content (like tasks and requirements),
to make the content re-usable, and to enable special listings of
roles.
