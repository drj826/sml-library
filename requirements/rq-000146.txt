description:: The software shall enable a user to generate a list of
abbreviations. The list may go in either the front matter or the back
matter.  If abbreviations are used in the text or in footnotes, the
list should appear in the front matter. If they are only used in the
back matter, the list should appear before the first part in which
abbreviations are used, whether the appendixes, the end-notes, or the
bibliography.
