type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to identify and
represent document content as the description of a problem.  A problem
describes something to be solved.  Problems are often called
requirements.  The purpose of identifying content as a problem
description is to make the problem semantically traceable to other
elements of content (like tests and solutions), to make the content
re-usable, and to enable special listings of problems.

Elements of problem meta data include:

:: element
