description:: The software shall permit the user to disable subversion
(SVN) functions.  SVN functions include: (1) warning the user of
uncommitted changes to document files, (2) automatic updates of inline
revision numbers of included files.  Execution of these SVN functions
is not always necessary and causes significant runtime performance
degradation.  The purpose of this requirement is to give users the
choice of whether to enable or disable these functions.
