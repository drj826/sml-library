description:: The software shall remove markup from content blocks.
The purpose of this requirement is to strip markup text from content
leaving only the value of a content block. Several types of content
blocks like list items and elements include markup in their content.
Some software functions like formatter functions require the value of
these blocks ~~without~~ the markup.  The software must have the
capability to return the value of the content without the markup.
