priority:: routine

is_part_of:: rq-000195

type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to identify
and represent document content as the description of a test.  A test
describes a method of verifying a problem has been solved or
validating that a solution works correctly.  Individual tests are
often called ``test cases.'' The purpose of identifying content as a
test is to make that test semantically traceable to other elements of
content (like problems and solutions), to make the content re-usable,
and to enable special listings of tests.
