type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to identify and
represent document content as the description of a test.  A test
describes a method of verifying a problem has been solved or
validating that a solution works correctly.  Tests are often called
``test cases.'' The purpose of identifying content as a test is to
make that test semantically traceable to other elements of content
(like problems and solutions), to make the content re-usable, and to
enable special listings of tests.
