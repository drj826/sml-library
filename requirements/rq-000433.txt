type:: activity

is_part_of:: rq-000354          # Understand Requirements

description:: The organization shall describe ~~what~~ a solution does
or should do.  This activity is sometimes called [g:CMMI:functional
analysis]. The work product of this activity is a [g:IEEE:functional
baseline] which consists of [g:SML:functional requirement]s arranged
in a [g:CMMI:functional architecture]. The [g:IEEE:functional
baseline] is often documented in a [g:IEEE:functional specification].

index:: rq-000433; functional analysis

The first step in understanding requirements is often answering the
questions, ``What does a solution do?'' or ``What is a solution
~~supposed~~ to do?''  The purpose of [g:CMMI:functional analysis] is
to produce work products that answer these questions.
