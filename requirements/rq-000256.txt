Users often use a change control application to collaborate on
document development.  Just as in software development, document
developers use change repositories to share changes with one another.

This requirement is intentionally vague about specific change control
applications because I don't want the software to be tightly coupled
to any specific change control application. As a practical matter,
however, I primarily use Subversion for change control.
