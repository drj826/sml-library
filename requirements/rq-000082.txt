description:: The data format shall be human readable.  It should be as
easy as possible for people to read and understand raw text manuscript
files.  The purpose of this requirement is to keep the data format as
readable as possible so people are comfortable reading and writing in
the raw data format using simple text editing tools.

Markup languages like XML and HTML also have a goal of being human
readable but have accumulated so much complexity that most files are
difficult to read.  To maximize human readability, the data format
should make it easy for people to distinguish markup from content and
should keep the ratio of markup to content to an absolute minimum.
