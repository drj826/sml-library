variable declaration.  A variable consists of a name and a value.  The

enabling authors to define a variable in a single location and use the
value of that variable in multiple locations.

Variables are meant to represent ~~inline~~ elements of content; that
is, content that potentially consists of ~~partial~~ lines of text.
Inserts, on the other hand, are meant to represent ~~blocks~~ of
content; that is, content that consists of one or more ~~whole~~ lines
of text.
