title:: Represent an Option to `Include and Hide'

priority:: routine

type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
an `include' and hide statement to include content from another
locations ~~and hide the included content~~.  This means the elements
contained in the included file are made available for re-use but the
content itself is not rendered.  For instance, an author might wish to
include a list of requirement titles but not the full text of the
requirements themselves.  This will enable the author to include the
requirements as ~~hidden~~ and insert their titles using a literal
string and the full text of the requirements will not be rendered.
