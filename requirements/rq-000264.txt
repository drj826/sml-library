title:: Publish a Static HTML Document List of Changes

is_part_of:: rq-000001          # Publish an SML Document to Static HTML

type:: functional

description:: The software shall publish a static HTML document list
of changes since the previous version.  The purpose of this change
listing is to notify readers which entities and structures have been
updated since the previous version and to enable the user to quickly
navigate to any recently updated entity or structure. This must be an
automatically rendered listing of change-log entries by entity and
structure name.

index:: rq-000264; list of changes!HTML; HTML list of changes

For example, if the document is a system design document containing
entities like requirements, configuration items, allocations, and test
cases, then the list of changes would list the changes for each of
these entity types, listing which ones have been recently updated
along with the change-log entry committed with the change.

outcome::2016-03-20:rq-000264:green: This requirement is
complete. (Don Johnson)
