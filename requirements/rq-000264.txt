description:: The software shall generate an HTML list of recent
updates.  The purpose of this list is to notify readers which entities
have been recently updated and to enable the user to quickly navigate
to any recently updated entity. This is an automatically generated
listing of changelog entries by entity type of entities that have been
recently updated.  The definition of ``recent'' should be configurable
by the user as some number of days.

index:: [id:rq-000264]; list of recent updates!HTML; HTML list of recent
updates

For example, if the document is a system design document containing
entities like requirements, configuration items, allocations, and test
cases, then the list of recent updates would have a section for each
of these entity types, listing which ones have been recently updated
along with the changelog entry committed with the change.

= [g:SML2:entity] = [def:SML2:entity]

This requirement is similar to but different from [id:rq-000278],
``[lookup:title:rq-000278]'' which lists recent changes in
chronological order rather than grouping recent changes by entity
type.
