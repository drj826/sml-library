title:: Define the Syntax for an Internal Hyperlink String

is_part_of:: rq-000407

type:: data format

associated:: rq-000021

associated:: rq-000020

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
an inline hyperlink to a location internal to the library.  This
capability must allow authors to designate arbitrary ``from'' span of
text as the beginning end of the hyperlink and to designate an
arbitrary location in the document as the target end of the hyperlink.

index:: rq-000187; internal hyperlink; hyperlink!internal

This syntax will be different than a cross reference because it will
allow the author to specify the text to display in the document.  A
cross reference will display a location description and not text
specified by the author.
