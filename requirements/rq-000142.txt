that follows it but exclude any front matter parts that follow it.  It
should list the title and beginning page number of each section of the
book including the front matter, text divisions, and back matter,
including the index.  If the book is divided into parts as well as
chapters, the part titles appear in the contents, but their page
numbers are omitted.[cite:cms15, [section]1.41]
