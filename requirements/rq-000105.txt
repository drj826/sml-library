description:: The software shall parse [a:SML] divisions.  This means
the software shall perform a syntactic analysis of text to check for
correct syntax and to build a data structure implicit in the input
tokens.  It includes the function of resolving specified statements
that implement special features defined by the SML data format. The
result of parsing is a collection of memory resident objects that
represent the parsed document.
