type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
an attachment.  This capability, similar to an E-mail attachment,
enables an author to insert a file into a document for explanation and
reference.  Readers of soft-copy document renditions should have the
capability to detach and open attachments.  Attachments have titles
and descriptions (often called captions) and unique identifiers that
allow cross referencing within the document.
