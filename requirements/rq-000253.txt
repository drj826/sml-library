title:: Define the Syntax for a Unique Division Identifier

is_part_of:: rq-000361

type:: data format

description:: The data format shall define the syntax for a unique
division identifier which is part of the start division syntax.  This
unique identifier will make it possible to refer to the division from
anywhere else in the library.  The purpose for making the unique ID
part of the start division syntax is to simplify parsing.  Keeping the
ID part of the start syntax enables the parser to immediately create
the division object without looking ahead for the ID.
