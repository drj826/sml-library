title:: Represent a File Path

is_part_of:: rq-000120

type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent a
filesystem path.  A filesystem path defines the name and location of
a file in a hierarchical filesystem.  The files themselves may or may
not be part of the documentation and therefore the software does not
validate that these inline file paths actually exist.
