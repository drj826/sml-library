type:: data format

associated:: rq-000095

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
the result of a review.  A review is an ~~informal~~ evaluation of an
item's status.  Any item with a status attribute may be the subject of
a review (problem, solution, test, task, exercise, demonstration,
etc.).  The data format must have the capability to represent the date
of review, label of item reviewed, item status determined by the
review, and a one-paragraph explanation of how the status was
determined.

Note that ~~reviews~~ are for documenting the ~~informally~~
determined status of an item.  ~~Outcomes~~, on the other hand, are
for documenting the ~~formally~~ determined status of an item (See
[id:rq-000095]).

~~Reviews~~ and ~~outcomes~~ should have a similar data format to make
it easy to promote a review to an outcome.
