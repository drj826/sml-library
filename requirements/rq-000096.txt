title:: Permit a User to Set a `Use Formal Status' Option

is_part_of:: rq-000375

type:: data format

description:: The technical solution shall permit a user to set a `use
formal status' option.  This option, when set, means that
[g:SML2:entity] status must come from formal outcomes rather than from
informal entity status attributes.  The purpose of this requirement is
to enable authors to declare whether they want entity status to come
from formal test results and audits, ~~or~~ from the informal status
attributes of each entity (default).
