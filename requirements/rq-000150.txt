description:: The software shall enable a user to generate a list of
contributors. In a work by many authors in which only the volume
editor's name appears on the title page, a list of contributors often
appears in the back matter, immediately before the index.  Names are
arranged alphabetically but not inverted (``John A. Smith,'' not
``Smith, John A.'').  Brief biological notes, academic affiliations,
or, as in many symposium volumes, office addresses accompany the
names. [cite:cms15, [section]1.89]
