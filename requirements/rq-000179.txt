description:: The software shall resolve included raw text.  The
[a:SML] data format enables authors to include the content of an
external file as a raw text, meaning, the text should be included ~~as
is~~ with no alterations at `include' time.  Note that raw text is
~~not~~ the same as pre-formatted text.
