type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
an `include' flat statement to include content from another locations
~~with the section structure of the included document flattened~~.
That means, if the included file contains a section structure, convert
each section heading to bold text.  The purpose of this requirement is
to enable re-use of content with section structure in places where
section structure is not allowed.  For instance, this will allow an
author to reuse a file containing a section structure in an
``exercise;'' a division which is not allowed to contain section
headings.
