title:: Define the Syntax for a Title Reference String

type:: data format

is_part_of:: rq-000407

associated:: rq-000408

description:: The data format shall define the syntax for a title
reference string.  The purpose of a property reference string is to
``look up'' the title of any division in the library and re-use it in
another location.  For instance if you have a figure title you wish to
show in other locations you should have the ability to ``look up'' the
title property of the figure.

index:: rq-000409; string!title reference

outcome::2016-03-09:rq-000409:yellow: This requirement is complete.
However, it calls for a subset of the functionality required by
[id:rq-000408] and is therefore redundant.  I'm making this yellow
because we need to decide whether to eliminate the title reference
syntax and use the lookup syntax in its place. (Don Johnson)
