type:: data format

is_part_of:: rq-000407

description:: The data format shall define the syntax for a title
reference string.  The purpose of a property reference string is to
``look up'' the title of any division in the library and re-use it in
another location.  For instance if you have a figure title you wish to
show in other locations you should have the ability to ``look up'' the
title property of the figure.
