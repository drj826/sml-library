type:: data format

associated:: rq-000005 # Minimize Presentation Markup

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
document [g:SML:presentation] features. [G:SML:presentation] features
allow [g:SML:text] to be presented with a certain appearance (bold,
italics, line breaks, page breaks, font size, text justification,
etc.).  This requirement serves as a container for all
[g:SML:presentation] representation requirements.

For the most part the goal of SML is to minimize the ability for
document authors to control document presentation (See: [id:rq-000005]
[title:rq-000005]).  Therefore this requirement is intentionally
sparse.  Instead of enabling authors to control presentation, SML
forces authors to focus on document structure and content.  Document
presentation, for the most part, is left up to template designers.
