title:: Define the Syntax for the Start of a Table Row

type:: data format

is_part_of:: rq-000326

description:: The data format shall define the syntax for the start of
a [g:SML:TABLE_ROW].

index:: rq-000367; table row

outcome::2016-03-02:rq-000367:red: I'm not convinced this requirement
is necessary.  The technical solution I've chosen has ~~no~~ explicit
syntax for the start of a table row.  Instead, the start of a table
row is implied by either (1) the beginning of a table cell that marks
the beginning of a table, or (2) the beginning of the table cell
immediately following the end of a table row. (Don Johnson)
