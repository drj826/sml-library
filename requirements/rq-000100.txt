is_part_of:: rq-000099

priority:: routine

type:: functional

description:: The software shall parse an SML conditional division.
The purpose of conditional text is to allow authors to publish
different versions of the same document depending on certain
conditions.  A conditional division directs the application to ignore
that division's text unless a certain condition is met (whether or not
a named token is defined).
