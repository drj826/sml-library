is_part_of:: rq-000443          # Publish an SML Library to Static HTML

type:: functional

associated:: rq-000264          # Publish a Static HTML Document List of Changes Page

description:: The software shall publish a static HTML library list
of changes since the previous version.  The purpose of this change
listing is to notify readers which entities and structures have been
updated since the previous version and to enable the user to quickly
navigate to any recently updated entity or structure. This must be an
automatically rendered listing of change-log entries by entity and
structure name.

index:: rq-000460; list of changes!HTML; HTML list of changes

For example, if the library contains systems engineering documents
containing entities like requirements, configuration items,
allocations, and test cases, then the list of changes would list the
changes for each of these entity types, listing which ones have been
recently updated along with the change-log entry committed with the
change.

outcome::2016-03-25:rq-000460:green: This requirement is completely
defined. (Don Johnson)
