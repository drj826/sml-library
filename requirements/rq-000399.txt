type:: data format

is_part_of:: rq-000389

associated:: rq-000048

description:: The data format shall define the syntax for a single
quoted string. A single quoted string must be contained within a
single [g:SML:block]. The syntax must distinguish between the open and
close quotes. This requirement is identified because 7-bit ASCII does
not represent left or right single quotation marks, although ASCII
code 96 ``grave accent'' and ASCII ``apostophe'' are often used as a
substitutes.

complete. (Don Johnson)
