type:: functional

description:: The system shall enable a user to publish an [ac:SML]
[g:SML:DOCUMENT] to static HTML.  The purpose of producing static HTML
is to enable simple document sharing via storage devices like CD, DVD,
or USB drives and by uploading to content management web services.

Many SML documents are large and complex.  Rendering them to a single
large HTML file would result in slow navigation because web browsers
are not optimized for very large HTML files.  Therefore, the best way
to meet this requirement is to render the SML document into a
~~collection~~ of navigable HTML pages.
