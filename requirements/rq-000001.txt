title:: Render Documents from SML to Static HTML

is_part_of:: rq-000098

priority:: routine

type:: functional

description:: The system shall enable a user to render
[g:SML:DOCUMENT]s from [g:SML:Semantic Manuscript Language] (SML)
sources to static HTML documents.  The purpose of producing static
HTML is to enable simple document sharing via storage devices like CD,
DVD, or USB drives and by uploading to content management web
services.

index:: rq-000001; HTML!render static

Many SML documents are large and complex.  Rendering them to a single
large HTML file would result in slow navigation because web browsers
are not optimized for very large HTML files.  Therefore, the best way
to meet this requirement is to render the SML document into a
~~collection~~ of navigable HTML pages.
