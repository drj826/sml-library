Many SML documents are large and complex.  Rendering them to a single
large HTML file would result in slow navigation because web browsers
are not optimized for very large HTML files.  Therefore, the best way
to meet this requirement is to render the SML document into a
~~collection~~ of navigable HTML pages.
