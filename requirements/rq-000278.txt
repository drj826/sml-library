description:: The software shall generate an HTML changelog.  The
purpose of this list is to notify readers of recent changes to the
document in chronological order. This is an automatically generated
listing of recent changelog entries in chronological order. The
definition of ``recent'' should be configurable by the user as some
number of days.

index:: [id:rq-000278]; changelog!HTML; HTML changelog

This requirement is similar to but different from [id:rq-000264],
``[lookup:title:rq-000264]''  which groups recent changes by entity
type rather than listing them in chronological order.
