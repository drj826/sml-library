type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
re-usable parts of document content.  The purpose of this requirement
is to maximize document maintainability by enabling authors to capture
content in one and only one place and providing ways to re-use that
content in other places within a document.  A ``part'' of document
content may be a [g:SML:division], [g:SML:block], or
[g:SML:string]. This requirement serves as a container for more
specific document content reuse data format requirements.
