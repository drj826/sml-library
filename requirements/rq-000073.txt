type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
re-usable elements of document content.  The purpose of this
requirement is to maximize document maintainability by enabling a
single definitive location for an element of document content and
providing ways to re-use that content in other places within a
document.  An ``element'' of document content may either be a
~~block~~ of content which consists of one or more ~~whole~~ lines of
text, or an ~~inline~~ element of content which may consist of
~~partial~~ lines of text.  This requirement serves as a container for
more specific document content reuse data format requirements.
