description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent a
comment.  Comments are text that appear in the source data format but
not in published renditions.  Comments are designed to serve multiple
purposes: (1) allow explanations of document content that do not
appear in published documents, (2) allow authors to temporarily
``comment out'' document content.  This requirement serves as a
container for various data format comment representation requirements.
