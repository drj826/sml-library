description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
inference rules.  An inference rule is a statement in the form of an
if-then (antecedent-consequent) sentence that describe the logical
inferences that can be drawn from an assertion.  The purpose of this
requirement is to ensure the data format features the necessary syntax
and semantics to express rules.  Within the context of artificial
intelligence and expert systems, inference rules are also known as (or
closely related to) axioms, relations, and productions.

index:: [id:rq-000194]; inference rules

Each rule has a unique identifier, a left-hand-side (the `if' part
also known as the antecedent), and a right-hand-side (the `then' part
also known as the consequent).  The left-hand-side is a condition and
the right-hand-side is an action.
