title:: Represent an `Include' Statement

priority:: routine

is_part_of:: rq-000073

type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
an `include' statement to include content from other locations.
Additionally, the data format must provide the specified variations of
included content.  The default variation is to include the content as
a section at the same level as the previous section heading.  The
purpose of this requirement is to enable authors to modularize and
reuse document content by storing it in multiple files and then
combining it into documents as necessary. The markup that implements
this ``include'' mechanism should be ignored if it occurs within a
comment or within a conditional text block that is conditionally
~~not~~ part of the current document.
