title:: Preserve Division Order

is_part_of:: rq-000128

priority:: routine

type:: technical

description:: The software shall remember the order in which divisions
occur in a document.  The purpose of this requirement is to enable
other software functions to list labeled divisions, especially
entities, in the order in which they appear in the document. This
requirement applies to all divisions at the same time, meaning, the
software should not remember order of entities independently by type
(i.e. problem, solution, etc.).  This will enable the software to list
divisions in document order both independent of type and by type.
