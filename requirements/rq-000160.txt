type:: data format

associated:: rq-000159

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
the author's choice that the output of a script should persist in a
specified file.  The default behavior of the script function is to run
the script and insert the output into the generated document but
~~not~~ persist the output anywhere.

index:: [id:rq-000160]; scripts!persistent output

This requirement is ~~different~~ than [id:rq-000159] because it
requires the data format to represent an option to persist script
output to ~~any~~ specified file, not just within the file that
represents the document itself.
