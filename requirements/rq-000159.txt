title:: Represent an Option to Persist Script Output In Document

priority:: routine

is_part_of:: rq-000072

type:: data format

associated:: rq-000160

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
the author's choice that the output of a script should persist in the
containing document.  The default behavior of the script function is
to run the script and insert the output into the generated document
but ~~not~~ persist the output in the original document.

index:: [id:rq-000159]; scripts!persistent output

This requirement is ~~different~~ than [id:rq-000160] because it
requires the data format to represent an option to persist script
output in the file that represents the document and not just to any
file specified by the author.
