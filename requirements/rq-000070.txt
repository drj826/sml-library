description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
hidden text.  Hidden text is document content that appears in the
source data but not in published document renditions.  The difference
between hidden text and commented text is that the meta-data portions
of hidden text must be available for use in the document using a
variety of reusable content mechanisms.
