title:: Define the Syntax for a Variable Reference String

type:: data format

is_part_of:: rq-000407

description:: The data format shall define the syntax for a variable
reference string.  The purpose of a variable reference string is to
refer to the value of a variable previously defined anywhere else in
the library. The syntax must support the specification of an optional
namespace string.  The purpose of the namespace string is to allow the
same variable name to have different definitions in different
contexts.
