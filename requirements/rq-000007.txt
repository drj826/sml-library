priority:: routine

is_part_of:: rq-000107

type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to represent
semantic [g:SML:content].  Semantic [g:SML:content] features allow
[g:SML:division]s of a document to have special meaning (i.e.,
[g:SML:EXERCISE]s, [g:SML:SLIDE]s, [g:SML:QUOTATION]s, [g:SML:DEMO],
[g:SML:problem]s, [g:SML:solution]s, [g:SML:test]s, [g:SML:result]s,
[g:SML:task]s, and [g:SML:role]s).  This requirement serves as a
container for all [g:SML:content] representation requirements.
