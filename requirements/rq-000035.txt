type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to identify and
represent document content as the description of results.  A result
describes the outcome of a review, test, or audit.  The purpose of
identifying content as a result is to make that result semantically
traceable to other elements of content (like problems, solutions, and
tests), to make the content re-usable, and to enable special listings
of results.
