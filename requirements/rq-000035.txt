type:: data format

description:: The data format shall have the capability to identify
and represent document content as the description of a result.  A
result describes the outcome of a review, test, or audit.  The purpose
of identifying content as a result is to make that result semantically
traceable to other elements of content (like requirements, solutions,
and tests), to make the content re-usable, and to enable special
listings of results.
