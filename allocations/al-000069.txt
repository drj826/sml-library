outcome::2012-09-04:al-000069:green: Since last analyzing whether SML
satisfies [id:rq-000035] ``[title:rq-000035],'' I've added
``allocation'' and ``assignment'' entities to the ontology.  Declaring
the outcome of allocation and assignment validation now satisfies
[id:rq-000035].

outcome::2011-11-27:al-000069:red: I'm not satisfied with the current
syntax for capturing reviews and outcomes.  The original purpose of an
outcome was to declare the status of a tested item.  This
works. However, I now think an outcome should declare the degree to
which a tested item meets a specific requirement.  The current syntax
does not capture the requirement against which the item is being
tested.  Furthermore, I may need to capture the ~~version~~ of the
tested item.  The current syntax provides no way to capture that.
These same issues apply to reviews.
