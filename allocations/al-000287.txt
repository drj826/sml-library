outcome::2016-02-05:al-000287:green: By convention, division names
that are all uppercase are reserved words.  Structure divisions
declared in the core ontology configuration ([id:ci-000006]) have
names which are all uppercase.  Entity divisions declared in the SML
Library ontology configuration ([id:ci-000477]) are all lowercase.

outcome::2012-03-31:al-000287:red: The SML-EBNF.txt does not yet
define reserved words and require them to be ALL UPPER CASE.  I have
begun using this convention, but nothing in the code yet enforces it.
