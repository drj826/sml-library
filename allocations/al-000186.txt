outcome::2012-01-31:al-000186:yellow: A couple features in the current
data format design make it difficult to debug certain errors.  For
example, the ~~implied~~ (rather than explicit) boundary between the
preamble and narrative often makes it difficult to find subtle syntax
errors that causes a premature beginning of the narrative.

outcome::2012-09-04:al-000186:yellow: Another characteristic of the
current data format that makes it difficult to debug is the fact that
environment start and end markup is the same.  Without the ability to
distinguish whether the author intends the markup to represent the
start or end of an environment, it is difficult to detect improper
nesting, and to direct the user to the likely location of the error.
This is especially true of comment divisions.  A missing or broken end
comment division marker ({lit:###comment}) can make the rest of the
document ``disappear'' and the application cannot notify the user (1)
that the application reached the end of the document while in a
comment division, and (2) where that comment division began.
