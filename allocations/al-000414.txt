outcome::2016-03-01:al-000414:red: The SML::Syntax does ~~not~~ define
the syntax for the end of a document section because the end of a
document section is implicit.  Two things can signify the end of a
document section: (1) the beginning of another section, or (2) the end
of the document.  The end of a document section is currently implied
by parser logic and not by the syntax specification.  This bothers me.
