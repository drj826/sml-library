outcome::2016-03-10:al-000113:red: The SML::Syntax class does ~~NOT~~
define the syntax for an ``em dash'' symbol.  Line 2484 of
[file:Syntax.pm] has a commented-out syntax definition.  I ran into
difficulty with the implementation of the chosen syntax (--) because
it collided with too many other symbols.  I plan to go back to the
drawing board in the future to implement an ``em dash'' symbol
syntax. (Don Johnson)
