title:: A Sample Document

author:: Bilbo Baggins

This is an example of a Semantic Manuscript Language (SML) document.
This is the first paragraph of the document.  Paragraphs are simply
blocks of text that are ~~not indented~~ (indented text is treated as
pre-formatted text).

In the preceding paragraph, the words ``not indented'' are surrounded
by double tildes.  This tells the publish program you wish to
~~italicize~~ the text.  If you're reading this in a published
rendition like PDF or HTML, you won't see the double tildes because
the publish program already changed them into actual italicized text.

Sometimes you need to make a list of items:

- Item 1

- Item 2

- Item 3

This SML text format has many other features like tables, sections,
figures, footnotes, bibliographies, indexes, etc.  We won't include
them in this simple example document because we want to keep it
simple.
