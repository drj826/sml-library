title:: IEEE Std 1012-2004 - IEEE Standard for Software Verification
and Validation

month:: April

year:: 2005

organization:: IEEE

institution:: The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,
Inc.

address:: 3 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016-5997, USA

note:: Software verification and validation (V&V) processes determine
whether the development products of a given activity conform to the
requirements of that activity and whether the software satisfies its
intended use and user needs.  Software V&V life cycle process
requirements are specified for different software integrity levels.
The scope of V&V processes encompasses software-based systems,
computer software, hardware, and interfaces.  This standard applies to
software being developed, maintained, or reused (legacy, commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS), non-developmental items).  The term software
also includes firmware, microcode, and documentation.  Software V&V
processes include analysis, evaluation, review, inspection,
assessment, and testing of software products.

title:: IEEE Recommended Practice for Architectural Description for
Software-Intensive Systems

year:: 2000

note:: This recommended practice addresses the activities of the
creation, analysis, and sustainment of architectures of
software-intensive systems, and the recording of such architectures in
terms of architectural descriptions.  A conceptual framework for
architectural description is established.  The content of an
architectural description is defined.  Annexes provide the rationale
for key concepts and terminology, the relationships to other
standards, and examples of usage.

management; data types; errors, faults, and failures; evaluation
techniques; instruction types; language types; libraries;
microprogramming; operating systems; quality attributes; software
documentation; software and system testing; software architecture;
software development process; software development techniques; and
software tools.

title:: IEEE Standard Taxonomy for Software Engineering Standards

year:: 1987

note:: This document describes the form and content of a software
engineering standards taxonomy. Applicability is not restricted by
software application, size, complexity, criticality, or hardware
environment. This taxonomy applies to standards (from the related
disciplines of engineering management, systems engineering, computer
hardware engineering, computer science, and information science) with
which a software engineer would be reasonably acquainted.

title:: IEEE Standard for Software Unit Testing

year:: 1987

note:: This standard's primary objective is to specify a standard
approach to software unit testing that can be used as a basis for
sound software engineering practice.  A second objective is to
describe the software engineering concepts and testing assumptions on
which this standard approach is based. This information is contained
in Appendix B. Note that Appendix B is not a part of this standard.  A
third objective is to provide guidance and resource information to
assist with the implementation and usage of the standard unit testing
approach. This information is contained in Appendixes A, C, and
D. Note that these Appendixes are not a part of this standard.

title:: Systems and software engineering -- Software Life cycle
processes

year:: 2008

note:: This International Standard establishes a common framework for
software life cycle processes, with well-defined terminology, that can
be referenced by the software industry. It applies to the acquisition
of systems and software products and services, to the supply,
development, operation, maintenance, and disposal of software products
and the software portion of a system, whether performed internally or
externally to an organization. Those aspects of system definition
needed to provide the context for software products and services are
included. Software includes the software portion of firmware. This
revision integrates ISO/IEC 12207:1995 with its two amendments and was
coordinated with the parallel revision of ISO/IEC 15288:2002 (System
life cycle processes) to align structure, terms, and corresponding
organizational and project processes. This standard may be used stand
alone or jointly with ISO/IEC 15288, and supplies a process reference
model that supports process capability assessment in accordance with
ISO/IEC 15504-2 (Process assessment). An annex provides support for
IEEE users and describes relationships of this International Standard
to IEEE standards.

title:: Systems and software engineering -- System life cycle processes

year:: 2008

note:: This International Standard establishes a common process
framework for describing the life cycle of man-made systems. It
defines a set of processes and associated terminology for the full
life cycle, including conception, development, production,
utilization, support and retirement. This standard also supports the
definition, control, assessment, and improvement of these
processes. These processes can be applied concurrently, iteratively,
and recursively to a system and its elements throughout the life cycle
of a system.

title:: IEEE Standard for Software and System Test Documentation

year:: 2008

note:: Test processes determine whether the development products of a
given activity conform to the requirements of that activity and
whether the system and/or software satisfies its intended use and user
needs. Testing process tasks are specified for different integrity
levels.  These process tasks determine the appropriate breadth and
depth of test documentation. The documentation elements for each type
of test documentation can then be selected. The scope of testing
encompasses software-based systems, computer software, hardware, and
their interfaces. This standard applies to software-based systems
being developed, maintained, or reused (legacy, commercial
off-the-shelf, Non-Developmental Items). The term ``software'' also
includes firmware, microcode, and documentation. Test processes can
include inspection, analysis, demonstration, verification, and
validation of software and software-based system products.
