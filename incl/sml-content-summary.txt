: !!Slides.!! ([ref:slides]) Slides (often containing bulletized lists
and/or images) designed for training or other presentations can be
easily added to documents.  This makes it easy to create instructor
notes. In the HTML rendition, navigation links enable you to: (1)
advance to the next slide, (2) go back to the previous slide, and (3)
view the list of slides.

: !!Key-points.!! ([ref:keypoints]) Often included at the beginning of
a chapter, a `keypoints' block is a boxed region that identifies the
key points of that chapter.  In the HTML rendition, navigation links
enable you to advance to the next key points box or go back to the
previous key points box.  This enables readers to very quickly get a
feel for the content of the document.
