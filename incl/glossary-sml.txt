infer logical consequences from a set of asserted facts or axioms. The
notion of a semantic reasoner generalizes that of an inference engine,
by providing a richer set of mechanisms to work with. The inference

glossary:: unit test {SML} = The lowest level of automated test, often
called an ``assertion,'' that tests a single program function or
configuration for expected success or failure

glossary:: unit test case {SML} = (1) An automated, repeatable
[g:IEEE:test case] containing [g:SML:unit test]s; (2) A unit test case
description file that uniquely identifies and describes a unit test
case and serves to establish traceability between unit test cases,
test results, configuration items, and requirements.  A unit test case
traces to a single test result file

glossary:: use case {SML} = A technique for capturing functional
requirements of business systems and, potentially, of an IT system to
support the business system.  The use case model uses ``Actors'' and
``use cases.'' An Actor is the representation of a person or system
which exists outside the system under study and who (or which)
performs a sequence of activities in a dialog with the system.  A Use
Case represents a single interaction between a primary actor (who
initiates the interaction) and other (secondary) actors, and the
system itself. The interaction is presented as a sequence of simple
steps

glossary:: variable definition {SML} = A [g:SML:definition] that
defines a key/value pair where the key is the variable name and the
value is the definition.  Variable definitions are limited to a single
block of text

glossary:: video {SML} = A [g:SML2:structure] that instructs the
publishing application to insert a video clip into the document
