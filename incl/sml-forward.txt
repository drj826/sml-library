Thank you for reading this.

The purpose of this section is to awaken your awareness that most
engineering documentation does not fulfill its purpose.  The rest of
this document describes what to do about it.

Have you ever started reading a requirements document with the
~~expectation~~ you would learn what the system does (or should do)
but after 10 minutes give up because the document doesn't serve the
purpose?

Have you ever started reading a design document with the
~~expectation~~ you would learn how the system works (or should work)
but after 10 minutes give up because the document doesn't serve the
purpose?

Have you ever started reading a test document with the ~~expectation~~
you would learn how the tests verify the system meets requirements but
after 10 minutes give up because the document doesn't serve the
purpose?

Perhaps the documents are out of date?

Have you heard the explanation that the documentation is out-of-date
because it's impossible to keep it current when you're doing agile
development?  Besides, doesn't agile mean you don't write
documentation only prototypes?

The ~~purpose~~ of requirements documentation is to create a common
understanding of the problem that has been (or needs to be) solved.
It should answer the questions, ``What does the system do?'' or ``What
is the system ~~supposed~~ to do?''

The ~~purpose~~ of the design documentation is to create a common
understanding of the solution that has been (or needs to be)
implemented. It should answer the questions, ``How does the system
work?'' or ``How is the system ~~supposed~~ to work?''

The ~~purpose~~ of test documentation is to create a common
understanding of how the test cases assure that the solution satisfies
the requirements.  I should anwer the challenge, ``Convince me your
test cases and results prove the solution satisfies the requirements''
and, ``Convince me your solution does what I need it to do.''

Perhaps I've just run into a string of bad projects, but I haven't
come across much documentation recently that serves these purposes.

Agile means being agile with ~~all~~ work products not just the
implemented solution.  Delivering value quickly and incrementally
applies to all valuable work products, not just code.

Can you be agile with documentation?  ~~Why not use the same processes
for documentation that enable you to be agile with your code?~~

Why not?
