interpret goals and practices in light of your organization's business
objectives.  When using any CMMI model, you must interpret the
practices so that they work for your organization. This term is used
in goals and practices where certain activities may not be done all of
the time. (See also [g:CMMI:appropriate] and [g:CMMI:as needed].)

or part of the performance and functionality of a higher level
requirement on a lower level architectural element or design component
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: alternative practice {CMMI} = A practice that is a
substitute for one or more generic or specific practices contained in
CMMI models that achieves an equivalent effect toward satisfying the
generic or specific goal associated with model practices. Alternative
practices are not necessarily one-for-one replacements for the generic
or specific practices [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: amplification {CMMI} = Amplifications are informative model
components that contain information relevant to a particular

in goals and practices where certain activities may not be done all of
the time. (See also [g:CMMI:adequate] and [g:CMMI:as needed].)
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: as needed {CMMI} = This phrase is used so that you can
interpret goals and practices in light of your organization's business
objectives.  When using any CMMI model, you must interpret the
practices so that they work for your organization. This term is used
in goals and practices where certain activities may not be done all
the time. (See also [g:CMMI:adequate] and [g:CMMI:appropriate].)
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: assessment {CMMI} = In the CMMI Product Suite, an appraisal
that an organization does internally for the purposes of process

term special cause of process variation is used in place of assignable
cause of process variation to ensure consistency. The two terms are
defined identically. (See [g:CMMI:special cause of process
variation].) [cite:cmmi]

framework enables new disciplines to be added to CMMI so that the new
disciplines will integrate with the existing ones. (See also
[g:CMMI:CMMI model] and [g:CMMI:CMMI Product Suite].)  [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: CMMI model {CMMI} = One from the entire collection of
possible models that can be generated from the CMMI Framework. Since
the CMMI Framework can generate different models based on the needs of
the organization using it, there are multiple CMMI models. (See also
[g:CMMI:CMMI Framework] and [g:CMMI:CMMI Product Suite].)  [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: CMMI model component {CMMI} = Any of the main architectural
elements that compose a CMMI model. Some of the main elements of a

developed around the CMMI concept. These products include the
framework itself, models, appraisal methods, appraisal materials, and
various types of training. (See also [g:CMMI:CMMI Framework] and
[g:CMMI:CMMI model].) [cite:cmmi]

###

glossary:: capability evaluation {CMMI} = An appraisal by a trained
team of professionals used as a discriminator to select suppliers, to
monitor suppliers against the contract, or to determine and enforce
incentives.  Evaluations are used to gain insight into the process
capability of a supplier organization and are intended to help
decision makers make better acquisition decisions, improve
subcontractor performance, and provide insight to a purchasing
organization. (See also [g:CMMI:appraisal] and [g:CMMI:assessment].)
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: capability level {CMMI} = Achievement of process
improvement within an individual process area. A capability level is
defined by the appropriate specific and generic practices for a
process area. (See also [g:CMMI:generic goal], [g:CMMI:generic

[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: capability level profile {CMMI} = In the continuous
representation, a list of process areas and their corresponding
capability levels. (See also [g:CMMI:achievement profile],
[g:CMMI:target profile], and [g:CMMI:target staging].)  The profile
may be an achievement profile when it represents the organization's
progress for each process area while advancing through the capability
levels. Or, the profile may be a target profile when it represents an
objective for process improvement [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: capability maturity model {CMMI} = ([acs:CMMI:CMM]) A model
that contains the essential elements of effective processes for one or
more disciplines and describes an evolutionary improvement path from
ad hoc, immature processes to disciplined, mature processes with
improved quality and effectiveness [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: capability maturity model integration {CMMI} =
([acs:CMMI:CMMI]) a process improvement training and appraisal program
and service administered and marketed by Carnegie Mellon University
([acs:CMMI:CMU]) and required by many DoD and U.S. Government contracts,
especially in software development. CMU claims CMMI can be used to
guide process improvement across a project, division, or an entire
organization. CMMI defines the following maturity levels for
processes: Initial, Managed and Defined

glossary:: capable process {CMMI} = A process that can satisfy its
specified product quality, service quality, and process performance
objectives. (See also [g:CMMI:stable process], [g:CMMI:standard

make up a baseline, conforms to a specified standard or
requirement. (See also [g:CMMI:audit], [g:CMMI:configuration item],
[g:CMMI:functional configuration audit], and [g:CMMI:physical
configuration audit].) [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: configuration baseline {CMMI} = The configuration
information formally designated at a specific time during a product's
or product component's life.  Configuration baselines, plus approved
changes from those baselines, constitute the current configuration
information.  (See also [g:CMMI:product lifecycle].) [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: configuration control {CMMI} = An element of configuration
management consisting of the evaluation, coordination, approval or
disapproval, and implementation of changes to configuration items
after formal establishment of their configuration identification.

item], and [g:CMMI:configuration management].)  [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: configuration control board {CMMI} = ([acs:CMMI:CCB]) A
group of people responsible for evaluating and approving or
disapproving proposed changes to configuration items, and for ensuring
implementation of approved changes. (See also [g:CMMI:configuration
item].)  Configuration control boards are also known as change control
boards [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: configuration identification {CMMI} = An element of
configuration management consisting of selecting the configuration
items for a product, assigning unique identifiers to them, and
recording their functional and physical characteristics in technical
documentation. (See also [g:CMMI:configuration item],
[g:CMMI:configuration management], and [g:CMMI:product].)  [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: configuration management {CMMI} = ([acs:CMMI:CM]) A
discipline applying technical and administrative direction and
surveillance to (1) identify and document the functional and physical
characteristics of a configuration item, (2) control changes to those
characteristics, (3) record and report change processing and
implementation status, and (4) verify compliance with specified
requirements. (See also [g:CMMI:configuration audit],
[g:CMMI:configuration control], [g:CMMI:configuration identification],
and [g:CMMI:configuration status accounting].) [cite:cmmi]

treated as a single entity in the configuration management
process. (See also [g:CMMI:configuration management].) [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: configuration status accounting {CMMI} = An element of
configuration management consisting of the recording and reporting of

identification, the status of proposed changes to the configuration,
and the implementation status of approved changes. (See also
[g:CMMI:configuration identification] and [g:CMMI:configuration
management].)  [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: continuous representation {CMMI} = A capability maturity
model structure wherein capability levels provide a recommended order
for approaching process improvement within each specified process
area.  (See also [g:CMMI:capability level], [g:CMMI:process area], and
[g:CMMI:staged representation].)  [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: contractor {CMMI} = Same as [g:CMMI:supplier] [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: corrective action {CMMI} = Acts or deeds used to remedy a
situation, remove an error, or adjust a condition [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: customer {CMMI} = The party (individual, project, or
organization) responsible for accepting the product or for authorizing
payment. The customer is external to the project (except possibly when
integrated teams are used, as in [acs:CMMI:IPPD]), but not necessarily
external to the organization. The customer may be a higher level
project. Customers are a subset of stakeholders. (See also
[g:CMMI:stakeholder].)  In most cases where this term is used, the
preceding definition is intended; however, in some contexts, the term
``customer'' is intended to include other relevant stakeholders. (See
also [g:CMMI:customer requirement].) [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: customer requirement {CMMI} = The result of eliciting,
consolidating, and resolving conflicts among the needs, expectations,
constraints, and interfaces of the product's relevant stakeholders in
a way that is acceptable to the customer. (See also
[g:CMMI:customer].) [cite:cmmi]

product size (e.g., problem reports per thousand lines of code)
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: defined {CMMI} = At maturity level 3, processes are well
characterized and understood, and are described in standards,
procedures, tools, and methods. The organization's set of standard
processes, which is the basis for maturity level 3, is established and
improved over time. These standard processes are used to establish
consistency across the organization. Projects establish their defined
processes by tailoring the organization's set of standard processes
according to tailoring guidelines. (See the glossary for a definition
of ``organization's set of standard processes.'') [cite:cmmi, pg 37]

glossary:: defined {CMMI-2} = A capability level 3 process is
characterized as a ``defined process.'' A defined process is a managed
(capability level 2) process that is tailored from the organization's
set of standard processes according to the organization's tailoring
guidelines, and contributes work products, measures, and other process
improvement information to the organizational process
assets. [cite:cmmi, pg 33]

glossary:: defined process {CMMI} = A managed process that is tailored
from the organization's set of standard processes according to the
organization's tailoring guidelines; has a maintained process
description; and contributes work products, measures, and other
process improvement information to the organizational process
assets. (See also [g:CMMI:managed process].) [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: derived measures {CMMI} = Data resulting from the
mathematical function of two or more base measures. (See also
[g:CMMI:base measure].) [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: derived requirements {CMMI} = Requirements that are not
explicitly stated in the customer requirements, but are inferred (1)
from contextual requirements (e.g., applicable standards, laws,
policies, common practices, and management decisions), or (2) from
requirements needed to specify a product component.  Derived
requirements can also arise during analysis and design of components
of the product or system. (See also [g:CMMI:product requirements].)
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: design review {CMMI} = A formal, documented, comprehensive,
and systematic examination of a design to evaluate the design
requirements and the capability of the design to meet these
requirements, and to identify problems and propose solutions
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: development {CMMI} = In the CMMI Product Suite, not only
development activities but also maintenance activities may be
included. Projects that benefit from the best practices of CMMI can
focus on development, maintenance, or both [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: developmental plan {CMMI} = A plan for guiding,
implementing, and controlling the design and development of one or
more products. (See also [g:CMMI:product lifecycle] and
[g:CMMI:project plan].) [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: discipline {CMMI} = In the CMMI Product Suite, the bodies
of knowledge available to you when selecting a CMMI model (e.g.,
systems engineering). The CMMI Product Team envisions that other
bodies of knowledge will be integrated into the CMMI Framework in the

companies. Companies may consist of many organizations in many
locations with different customers. (See also [g:CMMI:organization].)
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: entry criteria {CMMI} = States of being that must be
present before an effort can begin successfully [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: equivalent staging {CMMI} = A target staging, created using
the continuous representation, which is defined so that the results of
using the target staging can be compared to the maturity levels of the
staged representation. (See also [g:CMMI:capability level profile],
[g:CMMI:maturity level], [g:CMMI:target profile], and [g:CMMI:target
staging].)  Such staging permits benchmarking of progress among
organizations, enterprises, and projects, regardless of the CMMI
representation used. The organization may implement components of CMMI
models beyond those reported as part of equivalent staging. Equivalent
staging is only a measure to relate how the organization is compared
to other organizations in terms of maturity levels [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: establish and maintain {CMMI} = In the CMMI Product Suite,
you will encounter goals and practices that include the phrase
``establish and maintain.''  This phrase means more than a combination
of its component terms; it includes documentation and usage. For
example, ``Establish and maintain an organizational policy for
planning and performing the organizational process focus process''
means that not only must a policy be formulated, but it also must be
documented, and it must be used throughout the organization
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: framework {CMMI} = See [g:CMMI:CMMI Framework] [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: functional analysis {CMMI} = Examination of a defined
function to identify all the subfunctions necessary to the
accomplishment of that function; identification of functional
relationships and interfaces (internal and external) and capturing
these in a functional architecture; and flow down of upper level
performance requirements and assignment of these requirements to lower
level subfunctions. (See also [g:CMMI:functional architecture].)
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: functional architecture {CMMI} = The hierarchical
arrangement of functions, their internal and external (external to the
aggregation itself) functional interfaces and external physical
interfaces, their respective functional and performance requirements,
and their design constraints [cite:cmmi]

to verify that the development of a configuration item has been
completed satisfactorily, that the item has achieved the performance
and functional characteristics specified in the functional or
allocated configuration identification, and that its operational and

glossary:: generic goal {CMMI} = A required model component that
describes the characteristics that must be present to institutionalize
the processes that implement a process area. (See also
[g:CMMI:institutionalization].) [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: generic practice {CMMI} = An expected model component that
is considered important in achieving the associated generic goal. The
generic practices associated with a generic goal describe the
activities that are expected to result in achievement of the generic
goal and contribute to the institutionalization of the processes
associated with a process area [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: generic practice elaboration {CMMI} = An informative model
component that appears after a generic practice to provide guidance on
how the generic practice should be applied to the process area
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: goal {CMMI} = A required CMMI component that can be either
a generic goal or a specific goal. When you see the word goal in a
CMMI model, it always refers to a model component (e.g., generic goal
and specific goal). (See also [g:CMMI:generic goal],
[g:CMMI:objective], and [g:CMMI:specific goal].) [cite:cmmi]

also [g:CMMI:software engineering] and [g:CMMI:systems engineering].)
In CMMI, hardware engineering represents all technical fields (e.g.,
electrical or mechanical) that transform requirements and ideas into
tangible and producible products [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: higher level management {CMMI} = The person or persons who
provide the policy and overall guidance for the process, but do not
provide the direct day-to-day monitoring and controlling of the
process. Such persons belong to a level of management in the
organization above the immediate level responsible for the process and
can be (but are not necessarily) senior managers. (See also
[g:CMMI:senior manager].) [cite:cmmi]

######################################################################
# I
######################################################################

glossary:: incomplete {CMMI} = An ``incomplete process'' is a process
that either is not performed or partially performed. One or more of
the specific goals of the process area are not satisfied, and no
generic goals exist for this level since there is no reason to
institutionalize a partially performed process. [cite:cmmi,pg 33]

glossary:: incomplete process {CMMI} = A process that is not performed
or is performed only partially (also known as capability level 0). One
or more of the specific goals of the process area are not satisfied
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: informative CMMI components {CMMI} = CMMI components that
help model users understand the required and expected components of a
model. These components can contain examples, detailed explanations,
or other helpful information. Subpractices, notes, references, goal
titles, practice titles, sources, typical work products,
amplifications, and generic practice elaborations are informative
model components [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: initial {CMMI} = At maturity level 1, processes are usually
ad hoc and chaotic. The organization usually does not provide a stable
environment to support the processes. Success in these organizations
depends on the competence and heroics of the people in the
organization and not on the use of proven processes. In spite of this
chaos, maturity level 1 organizations often produce products and
services that work; however, they frequently exceed their budgets and
do not meet their schedules.  Maturity level 1 organizations are
characterized by a tendency to over commit, abandon processes in the
time of crisis, and not be able to repeat their past successes
again. [cite:cmmi, pg 36]

glossary:: institutionalization {CMMI} = The ingrained way of doing
business that an organization follows routinely as part of its
corporate culture [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: integrated product and process development {CMMI} =
([acs:CMMI:IPPD]) A systematic approach to product development that
achieves a timely collaboration of relevant stakeholders throughout
the product lifecycle to better satisfy customer needs [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: integrated team {CMMI} = A group of people with
complementary skills and expertise who are committed to delivering
specified work products in timely collaboration. Integrated team
members provide skills and advocacy appropriate to all phases of the
work products' life and are collectively responsible for delivering
the work products as specified. An integrated team should include
empowered representatives from organizations, disciplines, and
functions that have a stake in the success of the work products
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: interface control {CMMI} = In configuration management, the
process of (1) identifying all functional and physical characteristics
relevant to the interfacing of two or more configuration items
provided by one or more organizations, and (2) ensuring that the
proposed changes to these characteristics are evaluated and approved
prior to implementation. (See also [g:CMMI:configuration item] and
[g:CMMI:configuration management].)  [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: managed {CMMI} = At maturity level 2, the projects of the
organization have ensured that processes are planned and executed in
accordance with policy; the projects employ skilled people who have
adequate resources to produce controlled outputs; involve relevant
stakeholders; are monitored, controlled, and reviewed; and are
evaluated for adherence to their process descriptions. The process
discipline reflected by maturity level 2 helps to ensure that existing
practices are retained during times of stress. When these practices
are in place, projects are performed and managed according to their
documented plans.  At maturity level 2, the status of the work
products and the delivery of services are visible to management at
defined points (e.g., at major milestones and at the completion of
major tasks). Commitments are established among relevant stakeholders
and are revised as needed. Work products are appropriately
controlled. The work products and services satisfy their specified
process descriptions, standards, and procedures. [cite:cmmi, pg 36]

errors found in a product's first or second phase of development, and
reducing the number of customer-reported defects, when applied to
systems engineering activities [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: organization's measurement repository {CMMI} = A repository
used to collect and make available measurement data on processes and
work products, particularly as they relate to the organization's set
of standard processes. This repository contains or references actual

standards, procedures, plans, and training materials [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: organization's set of standard processes {CMMI} = A
collection of definitions of the processes that guide activities in an
organization. These process descriptions cover the fundamental process
elements (and their relationships to each other, such as ordering and

characterized as a ``performed process.'' A performed process is a
process that satisfies the specific goals of the process area. It
supports and enables the work needed to produce work products.
Although capability level 1 results in important improvements, those
improvements can be lost over time if they are not
institutionalized. The application of institutionalization (the CMMI
generic practices at capability levels 2 through 5) helps to ensure
that improvements are maintained. [cite:cmmi, pg 33]

characteristics of a process. It also may include procedures for
determining whether these provisions have been satisfied. Process
descriptions can be found at the activity, project, or organizational
level [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: process element {CMMI} = The fundamental unit of a
process. A process can be defined in terms of subprocesses or process
elements. A subprocess can be further decomposed into subprocesses or
process elements; a process element cannot. (See also [g:CMMI:process]

resulting products for the purpose of characterizing and understanding
the process [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: process owner {CMMI} = The person (or team) responsible for
defining and maintaining a process. At the organizational level, the
process owner is the person (or team) responsible for the description
of a standard process; at the project level, the process owner is the
person (or team) responsible for the description of the defined
process. A process may therefore have multiple owners at different
levels of responsibility.  (See also [g:CMMI:defined process] and
[g:CMMI:standard process].)  [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: process performance {CMMI} = A measure of actual results

relationships among attributes of a process and its work products that
is developed from historical process-performance data and calibrated
using collected process and product measures from the project and that
is used to predict results to be achieved by following a process
[cite:cmmi]

glossary:: process tailoring {CMMI} = Making, altering, or adapting a
process description for a particular end. For example, a project
tailors its defined process from the organization's set of standard
processes to meet the objectives, constraints, and environment of the
project. (See also [g:CMMI:defined process], [g:CMMI:organization's
set of standard processes], and [g:CMMI:process description].)

performance, and any other requirement [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: product lifecycle {CMMI} = The period of time, consisting
of phases, which begins when a product is conceived and ends when the
product is no longer available for use. Since an organization may be
producing multiple products for multiple customers, one description of
a product lifecycle may not be adequate.  Therefore, the organization
may define a set of approved product lifecycle models. These models
are typically found in published literature and are likely to be
tailored for use in an organization.  A product lifecycle could
consist of the following phases: (1) concept/vision, (2) feasibility,
(3) design/development, (4) production, and (5) phase out [cite:cmmi]

of interrelated resources which delivers one or more products to a
customer or end user. A project has a definite beginning (i.e.,
project startup) and typically operates according to a plan. Such a
plan is frequently documented and specifies what is to be delivered or
implemented, the resources and funds to be used, the work to be done,
and a schedule for doing the work. A project can be composed of
projects. (See also [g:CMMI:project startup].) [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: project manager {CMMI} = In the CMMI Product Suite, the

organization's set of standard processes to meet the objectives,
constraints, and environment of the project [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: tailoring guidelines {CMMI} = Organizational guidelines
that enable projects, groups, and organizational functions to
appropriately adapt standard processes for their use. The

guidelines aid those who establish the defined processes for
projects. Tailoring guidelines cover (1) selecting a standard process,
(2) selecting an approved lifecycle model, and (3) tailoring the
selected standard process and lifecycle model to fit project
needs. Tailoring guidelines describe what can and cannot be modified

component is that a work product is not necessarily part of the
product. (See also [g:CMMI:product] and [g:CMMI:product component].)
In CMMI models, you will see the phrase work products and
services. Even though the definition of work product includes
services, this phrase is used to emphasize the inclusion of services
in the discussion [cite:cmmi]

glossary:: work product and task attributes {CMMI} = Characteristics
of products, services, and project tasks used to help in estimating
project work. These characteristics include items such as size,
